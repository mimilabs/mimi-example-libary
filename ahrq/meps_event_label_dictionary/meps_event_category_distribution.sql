Title: MEPS Event Type Distribution and Description Analysis
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes the distribution of medical event types and their descriptions
in the MEPS survey data to understand the most common categories of healthcare 
utilization. This information is valuable for:
- Healthcare resource planning
- Understanding patterns of medical service usage
- Identifying key areas for healthcare access improvement
*******************************************************************************/

-- Main query analyzing event categories and their descriptions
WITH event_categories AS (
  -- Get distinct categories and their descriptions, excluding nulls
  SELECT DISTINCT 
    category,
    value,
    value_desc
  FROM mimi_ws_1.ahrq.meps_event_label_dictionary
  WHERE category IS NOT NULL
    AND value_desc IS NOT NULL
),

category_counts AS (
  -- Calculate frequency of each event category
  SELECT 
    category,
    COUNT(*) as category_count
  FROM event_categories
  GROUP BY category
)

-- Final output combining counts with descriptions
SELECT 
  ec.category,
  cc.category_count,
  -- Create array of distinct value descriptions for each category
  COLLECT_LIST(DISTINCT ec.value_desc) as event_descriptions
FROM event_categories ec
JOIN category_counts cc ON ec.category = cc.category
GROUP BY ec.category, cc.category_count
ORDER BY cc.category_count DESC;

/*******************************************************************************
How this query works:
1. First CTE gets distinct event categories and their descriptions
2. Second CTE calculates frequency counts for each category
3. Final query joins these together and aggregates descriptions into arrays

Assumptions/Limitations:
- Assumes category and value_desc fields are meaningful when not null
- Does not account for changes across different survey years
- Descriptions are treated as equivalent regardless of their associated values

Possible Extensions:
1. Add year-over-year trend analysis for event categories
2. Break down categories by demographic variables (if available)
3. Add filters for specific types of medical events
4. Include proxy response analysis to assess reporting patterns
5. Add statistical analysis of category distributions

    - Additional Notes: The query provides a high-level view of medical event categories and their descriptions from the MEPS survey data. Note that it aggregates across all available years, which might mask temporal trends. The COLLECT_LIST function used for descriptions may need adjustment based on the specific Databricks runtime version being used.
