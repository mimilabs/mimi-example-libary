Title: MEPS Healthcare Variables Analysis Over Time
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes the evolution and distribution of healthcare-related variables
in the MEPS consolidated files across years. It helps researchers and analysts:
- Understand what types of healthcare data are collected
- Track changes in data collection over time
- Identify key healthcare measurement variables
*******************************************************************************/

WITH yearly_var_counts AS (
  -- Count distinct variables per year to see data collection changes
  SELECT 
    year,
    COUNT(DISTINCT varname) as num_variables
  FROM mimi_ws_1.ahrq.meps_consol_metadata
  GROUP BY year
),

key_vars AS (
  -- Identify healthcare-related variables by looking for key terms in descriptions
  SELECT DISTINCT
    varname,
    desc,
    COUNT(DISTINCT year) as years_present
  FROM mimi_ws_1.ahrq.meps_consol_metadata
  WHERE LOWER(desc) LIKE '%expenditure%'
     OR LOWER(desc) LIKE '%payment%'
     OR LOWER(desc) LIKE '%insurance%'
     OR LOWER(desc) LIKE '%health%'
  GROUP BY varname, desc
)

-- Combine the analyses to show trends and key variables
SELECT
  y.year,
  y.num_variables,
  k.varname as key_healthcare_var,
  k.desc as variable_description,
  k.years_present
FROM yearly_var_counts y
CROSS JOIN key_vars k
WHERE k.years_present >= 5 -- Focus on consistently tracked variables
ORDER BY y.year DESC, k.years_present DESC
LIMIT 100;

/*******************************************************************************
How this query works:
1. First CTE counts distinct variables per year to track dataset evolution
2. Second CTE identifies healthcare-related variables using keyword matching
3. Main query combines the CTEs to show both trends and key variables

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes healthcare variables contain specific keywords in descriptions
- Limited to variables present in 5+ years for consistency
- Top 100 results only for manageability

Possible Extensions:
1. Add more healthcare-related keywords to the key_vars CTE
2. Calculate year-over-year changes in variable counts
3. Analyze variable type distributions (numeric vs character)
4. Group variables by categories (expenditure, insurance, etc.)
5. Cross-reference with actual data availability/completeness

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on temporal analysis of healthcare variables in MEPS data. Keywords used for healthcare variable identification ('expenditure', 'payment', 'insurance', 'health') may need adjustment based on specific research needs. The 5-year presence threshold and 100-row limit are configurable parameters that may need modification for different analysis requirements.
