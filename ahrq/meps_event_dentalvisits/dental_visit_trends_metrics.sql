-- MEPS Dental Visit Analysis: Demographic and Cost Distribution
-- Purpose: Analyze key patterns in dental visits and expenditures to understand:
-- 1. Volume and types of dental services across years
-- 2. Payment distribution across different sources
-- 3. Basic utilization patterns
-- This analysis helps inform dental health policy and resource allocation

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to aggregate core visit metrics by year
-- 2. Calculates key dental service utilization percentages
-- 3. Computes payment distributions between family and insurance
-- 4. Presents yearly trends for analysis

-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- 1. Assumes valid payment data (non-null and reasonable values)
-- 2. Limited to basic service categories for simplicity
-- 3. Does not account for potential data quality issues
-- 4. Does not segment by demographics or geography

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add demographic breakdowns (age, gender, region)
-- 2. Include more detailed service types
-- 3. Add statistical analysis (year-over-year growth)
-- 4. Segment by insurance status
-- 5. Add seasonality analysis by month

    - Additional Notes: Query aggregates dental visit metrics over time covering patient volume, service mix, and payment patterns. Considers only complete years of data and may undercount total patients due to panel structure. Payment calculations assume consistent reporting across years and insurance types.
