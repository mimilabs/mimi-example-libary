-- Analyzing Nursing Home Affiliations with Health Systems

-- This query provides insights into the relationships between nursing homes and the health systems they are affiliated with.
-- It can be used to understand the geographic distribution of nursing homes, the characteristics of affiliated vs. independent homes,
-- and the potential impact of health system partnerships on nursing home quality and performance.

-- This query allows us to explore the following business value:

-- 1. Geographic distribution of nursing homes:
--    - Understand the distribution of nursing homes across different states, both affiliated and independent.
--    - Identify potential disparities in the availability of nursing homes linked to high-performing health systems.

-- 2. Characteristics of affiliated vs. independent nursing homes:
--    - Analyze the differences in corporate ownership and parent organization types between affiliated and independent nursing homes.
--    - Investigate whether nursing homes affiliated with health systems have different characteristics (e.g., size, quality measures) compared to independent homes.

-- 3. Potential impact of health system affiliation:
--    - Explore the relationship between health system affiliation and nursing home performance, such as quality of care, financial metrics, or adoption of best practices.
--    - Assess whether nursing homes affiliated with high-performing health systems demonstrate better outcomes compared to those without system partnerships.

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - The data represents a snapshot in time and may not reflect changes in affiliations or ownership that occur outside the dataset's timeframe.
-- - The linkage files do not provide detailed information about the nature of the relationship between health systems and nursing homes (e.g., level of integration, shared resources).
-- - Additional data sources, such as CMS quality measures or financial data, would be needed to fully analyze the impact of health system affiliation on nursing home performance.

-- Possible Extensions:
-- - Integrate the nursing home linkage data with other CMS datasets (e.g., Nursing Home Compare) to analyze the relationship between health system affiliation and nursing home quality metrics.
-- - Perform spatial analysis to identify geographic clusters of nursing homes affiliated with high-performing health systems and assess potential access disparities.
-- - Conduct regression analysis to quantify the impact of health system affiliation on nursing home financial performance, resource utilization, or adoption of evidence-based practices.
-- - Expand the analysis to include longitudinal data, tracking changes in affiliations over time and their impact on nursing home outcomes.
