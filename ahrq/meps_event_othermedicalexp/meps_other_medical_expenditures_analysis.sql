-- MEPS Other Medical Expenditures Analysis

-- This query analyzes the MEPS Other Medical Expenditures event file to understand the financial burden and distribution of other medical expenses among the U.S. population.

-- The key business value of this table is to provide insights into a critical yet often overlooked component of healthcare expenditures. Understanding the patterns and drivers of other medical expenses can help policymakers, healthcare providers, and insurers develop more targeted interventions and policies to improve financial access to care.

-- This query calculates the total and average other medical expenditures per person, and then groups the data by insurance coverage type to understand how these expenses vary across different populations.

-- The key assumptions and limitations are:
-- 1. The data only captures other medical expenses that are not included in other MEPS event files, so it may not be comprehensive.
-- 2. The data is subject to potential recall bias and underreporting by survey participants.
-- 3. The query only looks at the most recent year of data, so it does not capture trends over time.

-- Possible extensions of this query include:
-- 1. Analyzing other medical expenses by demographic factors such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, and income level.
-- 2. Investigating the impact of chronic conditions on other medical expenses.
-- 3. Exploring regional and urban/rural differences in other medical expenditures.
-- 4. Tracking changes in the proportion of total healthcare expenditures attributed to other medical expenses over time.
