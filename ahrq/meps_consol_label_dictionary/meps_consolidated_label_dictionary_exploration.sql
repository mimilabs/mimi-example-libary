This query demonstrates the core business value of the `mimi_ws_1.ahrq.meps_consol_label_dictionary` table by:

1. Selecting the `varname`, `value`, and `value_desc` columns to retrieve the variable name, corresponding numeric value, and descriptive label.
2. Filtering the results to focus on the 'REGION' variable, which is a commonly used variable in MEPS data analysis.
3. Ordering the results by the `value` column in ascending order to present the data in a logical and easily interpretable manner.

By running this query, you can see the available regional codes and their corresponding descriptions, which is essential for understanding and analyzing the geographic distribution of healthcare-related variables in the MEPS data.

Assumptions and Limitations:
- This query assumes that the `mimi_ws_1.ahrq.meps_consol_label_dictionary` table exists and is accessible in the database.
- The query focuses on the 'REGION' variable, but the table contains label information for many other variables in the MEPS datasets.

Possible Extensions:
- Expand the query to explore the labels and values for other variables of interest, such as 'RACE', 'SEX', or 'AGE_YEARS'.
- Utilize the label information to enhance data visualization and reporting, making the MEPS data more intuitive and user-friendly for various stakeholders.
- Develop automated processes to leverage the label dictionary for data validation, quality control, and standardization across multiple MEPS datasets or other related data sources.
