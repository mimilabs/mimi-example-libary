-- dmepos_supplier_specialty_performance.sql

-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyzes DMEPOS supplier performance metrics segmented by provider specialty to identify
-- which specialties are most effective at serving Medicare beneficiaries with specific conditions.
-- This helps identify market opportunities, benchmark performance, and optimize specialty-focused programs.

GROUP BY suplr_prvdr_spclty_desc

-- Focus on meaningful specialties with significant volume
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT suplr_npi) >= 5
AND SUM(tot_suplr_benes) >= 100

ORDER BY total_medicare_payments DESC;

-- How it works:
-- 1. Aggregates key performance metrics by provider specialty
-- 2. Calculates per-beneficiary and service mix ratios
-- 3. Includes patient complexity measures
-- 4. Filters for active specialties with meaningful volume

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Uses most recent year's data only
-- - Excludes very small suppliers for statistical validity
-- - Specialty designations from claims/NPPES may have some inconsistencies
-- - Patient condition percentages may be underreported

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trend analysis by specialty
-- 2. Include geographic analysis of specialty distribution
-- 3. Develop specialty-specific quality metrics
-- 4. Compare outcomes across specialties for specific patient conditions
-- 5. Create peer group benchmarks within specialties

    - Additional Notes: This query focuses on specialty-level performance metrics for DMEPOS suppliers, analyzing financial, utilization, and patient complexity patterns. Results are filtered for statistical significance (minimum 5 suppliers and 100 beneficiaries per specialty). The analysis includes key condition prevalence rates for diabetes, COPD, and heart failure to understand patient population characteristics served by each specialty.
