/*******************************************************************************
How this query works:
1. Creates a CTE to calculate key metrics for each supplier
2. Filters for most recent year and non-suppressed beneficiary counts
3. Calculates per-service payments and percentage of total payments
4. Returns top 20 suppliers by Medicare payment amount

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Uses 2022 data - adjust date filter for other years
- Excludes suppliers with suppressed beneficiary counts (<11)
- Payment per service may be skewed by service mix differences
- State-level geographic variations not fully captured

Possible Extensions:
1. Add year-over-year trending analysis
2. Break down by DME vs POS vs Drug categories
3. Include geographic concentration analysis
4. Add beneficiary demographic breakdowns
5. Compare urban vs rural supplier patterns

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on 2022 data and excludes suppliers with suppressed beneficiary counts (<11). Payment metrics may not reflect complete supplier performance due to service mix variations. Consider adjusting the mimi_src_file_date parameter when analyzing different years.
