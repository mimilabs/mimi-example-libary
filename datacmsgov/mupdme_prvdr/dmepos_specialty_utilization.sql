-- dmepos_provider_utilization_patterns.sql
--
-- Business Purpose:
-- - Analyze provider utilization patterns for DMEPOS across different specialties
-- - Understand beneficiary demographics and chronic conditions impacting DMEPOS usage
-- - Support care coordination and medical necessity review strategies
-- 
-- The query examines key DMEPOS utilization metrics and beneficiary characteristics
-- by provider specialty to identify patterns and support medical review strategies.

SELECT 
    -- Provider identification and specialty
    rfrg_prvdr_spclty_desc,
    COUNT(DISTINCT rfrg_npi) as provider_count,
    
    -- DMEPOS utilization metrics 
    AVG(tot_suplr_srvcs) as avg_services_per_provider,
    AVG(tot_suplr_benes) as avg_beneficiaries_per_provider,
    
    -- Payment metrics
    AVG(suplr_mdcr_stdzd_pymt_amt) as avg_standardized_payment,
    AVG(suplr_mdcr_stdzd_pymt_amt/NULLIF(tot_suplr_srvcs,0)) as avg_payment_per_service,
    
    -- Beneficiary characteristics 
    AVG(bene_avg_age) as avg_beneficiary_age,
    AVG(bene_avg_risk_scre) as avg_risk_score,

    AVG(bene_cc_ph_diabetes_v2_pct) as avg_diabetes_pct,
    AVG(bene_cc_ph_ckd_v2_pct) as avg_ckd_pct

FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.mupdme_prvdr

-- Filter for most recent year and valid providers
WHERE mimi_src_file_date = '2022-12-31'
AND rfrg_prvdr_spclty_desc IS NOT NULL 
AND tot_suplr_srvcs > 0

-- Group and sort
GROUP BY rfrg_prvdr_spclty_desc
HAVING provider_count >= 10
ORDER BY avg_standardized_payment DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- How it works:
-- 1. Aggregates DMEPOS utilization and payment metrics by provider specialty
-- 2. Calculates average beneficiary characteristics and chronic condition prevalence
-- 3. Filters for active providers in most recent year with meaningful volume
-- 4. Limits to specialties with at least 10 providers for statistical relevance

-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- - Uses standardized payments to enable fair geographic comparisons
-- - Specialty classifications based on provider self-reporting
-- - Chronic condition percentages may be underreported due to claims lag
-- - Small volume providers excluded to focus on meaningful patterns

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trending analysis
-- 2. Break down by specific DMEPOS categories (DME vs POS vs Drug)
-- 3. Include geographic factors like rural/urban differences
-- 4. Add statistical testing for specialty comparisons
-- 5. Incorporate medical policy and LCD requirements

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on provider specialty-level patterns and includes key chronic condition indicators relevant to DMEPOS utilization. Results are limited to specialties with sufficient provider volume (n>=10) to ensure statistical relevance. Payment calculations use standardized amounts to enable fair geographic comparisons.
