-- dmepos_female_beneficiary_patterns.sql

-- Business Purpose:
-- - Analyze DMEPOS utilization and cost patterns for providers serving female Medicare beneficiaries
-- - Identify provider specialties with high proportions of female patients
-- - Support targeted outreach and care programs for women's health needs
-- - Uncover potential disparities in DMEPOS access for female beneficiaries

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Creates base table of providers filtered for most recent year and minimum beneficiary counts
-- 2. Calculates key metrics around female beneficiary patterns and costs
-- 3. Aggregates at specialty and state level to show geographic patterns
-- 4. Orders results by female percentage to identify specialties most focused on women's health

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Uses 2022 data - patterns may vary year over year
-- - Excludes providers with <11 total beneficiaries due to data suppression
-- - Does not account for specific DMEPOS product categories
-- - Female ratio calculations assume accurate gender reporting

-- Possible Extensions:
-- - Add trending over multiple years to show changing patterns
-- - Break down by specific DME/POS/Drug categories
-- - Include chronic condition correlations for female beneficiaries
-- - Compare urban vs rural female access patterns
-- - Analyze age group distributions within female population

    - Additional Notes: Query aggregates Medicare DMEPOS provider data focusing on female beneficiary patterns. Requires 2022 data in source table. Results limited to providers with 100+ total beneficiaries and non-zero female beneficiaries. Payment calculations exclude suppressed data (beneficiary counts <11).
