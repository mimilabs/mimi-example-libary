-- Title: Medicare Outpatient Service Outlier Payment Analysis

-- Business Purpose:
-- This query analyzes outlier payment patterns in Medicare outpatient services
-- to identify states and services with unusually high outlier rates and payments.
-- This information helps:
-- 1. Identify potential quality or coding issues requiring investigation
-- 2. Target compliance monitoring efforts
-- 3. Understand regional variations in complex cases
-- 4. Support budget forecasting for outlier payments

SELECT 
    rndrng_prvdr_geo_desc AS state,
    apc_desc,
    bene_cnt,
    capc_srvcs AS total_services,
    outlier_srvcs,
    -- Calculate outlier rate as percentage
    ROUND(100.0 * outlier_srvcs / NULLIF(capc_srvcs, 0), 2) AS outlier_rate_pct,
    -- Calculate average outlier payment per service
    ROUND(avg_mdcr_outlier_amt, 2) AS avg_outlier_payment,
    -- Calculate total estimated outlier payments
    ROUND(avg_mdcr_outlier_amt * outlier_srvcs, 2) AS total_outlier_payments
FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.mupohp_geo
WHERE mimi_src_file_date = '2022-12-31'  -- Most recent year
    AND rndrng_prvdr_geo_lvl = 'State'   -- State-level analysis
    AND outlier_srvcs > 0                 -- Only include services with outliers
    AND capc_srvcs >= 100                 -- Filter for meaningful volume
ORDER BY 
    total_outlier_payments DESC,
    outlier_rate_pct DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Focuses on states and services with outlier cases
-- 2. Calculates key metrics: outlier rates and payments
-- 3. Filters for meaningful volume (100+ services)
-- 4. Orders results by total outlier payments and rates
-- 5. Limits to top 20 results for focus on highest impact areas

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- 1. Assumes 2022 data is most recent and complete
-- 2. Minimum service volume of 100 may need adjustment
-- 3. Does not account for case mix complexity
-- 4. State-level aggregation masks facility-specific patterns

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year comparison of outlier trends
-- 2. Include correlation with total submitted charges
-- 3. Group services by clinical categories
-- 4. Add statistical analysis for outlier detection
-- 5. Create peer group comparisons based on state demographics

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on identifying areas with high outlier payment concentrations, which is particularly useful for compliance and quality monitoring teams. Consider running this analysis quarterly to detect emerging patterns early. The 100-service threshold may need adjustment based on specific state volumes.
