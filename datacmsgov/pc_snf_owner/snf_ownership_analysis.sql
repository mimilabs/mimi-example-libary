-- Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Ownership Analysis

-- This query explores the business value of the `mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.pc_snf_owner` table, which contains detailed ownership information for skilled nursing facilities in the United States.

-- The key business value of this data is to provide insights into the ownership structures and trends within the SNF industry, which can be used to:
-- 1. Understand the distribution of individual versus organizational ownership
-- 2. Identify patterns in ownership based on geographic location or facility size
-- 3. Analyze the potential impact of ownership on quality of care and patient outcomes
-- 4. Assess financial performance differences between SNFs with different ownership types
-- 5. Uncover potential conflicts of interest or related-party transactions

SELECT
  type_owner, -- Type of owner (individual or organization)
  COUNT(*) AS num_snfs, -- Number of SNFs for each owner type
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.pc_snf_owner), 2) AS pct_snfs -- Percentage of SNFs for each owner type
FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.pc_snf_owner
GROUP BY type_owner
ORDER BY num_snfs DESC;

-- This query provides a high-level overview of the distribution of individual versus organizational ownership in the SNF industry. 
-- The results can be used to understand the general landscape and identify any significant differences in the prevalence of each ownership type.

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - The data represents a snapshot in time and may not reflect the most current ownership structures.
-- - The anonymized nature of the data (use of PAC IDs and enrollment IDs) limits the ability to directly identify specific owners.
-- - The data does not provide information on the quality of care or financial performance of the SNFs, which would be needed to analyze the impact of ownership.

-- Possible Extensions:
-- - Analyze ownership patterns by geographic region, facility size, or other relevant characteristics.
-- - Investigate the relationship between ownership type and quality of care metrics, such as patient satisfaction, readmission rates, or deficiency citations.
-- - Examine the financial performance of SNFs with different ownership structures (e.g., for-profit vs. non-profit, individual vs. organizational).
-- - Identify potential conflicts of interest or related-party transactions by exploring the ownership networks and relationships between SNFs.
