-- rhc_npi_complexity_analysis.sql
 
-- Business Purpose:
-- This query analyzes the operational complexity and scale of Rural Health Clinics (RHCs)
-- by examining their NPI registration patterns to help:
-- - Identify RHCs with complex organizational structures (multiple NPIs)
-- - Assess potential administrative burden and reporting requirements
-- - Support operational planning and compliance monitoring
-- - Guide resource allocation for provider support services

WITH npi_stats AS (
  -- Calculate summary statistics of NPI patterns
  SELECT 
    organization_type_structure,
    proprietary_nonprofit,
    COUNT(*) as total_rhcs,
    SUM(CASE WHEN multiple_npi_flag = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as multi_npi_count,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN multiple_npi_flag = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) as multi_npi_pct
  FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.pc_ruralhealthclinic
  GROUP BY organization_type_structure, proprietary_nonprofit
)

SELECT
  organization_type_structure,
  CASE proprietary_nonprofit 
    WHEN 'P' THEN 'Proprietary'
    WHEN 'N' THEN 'Non-Profit'
    ELSE 'Unknown'
  END as ownership_type,
  total_rhcs,
  multi_npi_count,
  multi_npi_pct as multiple_npi_percentage,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY multi_npi_pct DESC) as complexity_rank
FROM npi_stats
WHERE organization_type_structure IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY multiple_npi_percentage DESC, total_rhcs DESC;

-- How it works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to aggregate NPI statistics by organization type and ownership status
-- 2. Calculates the count and percentage of RHCs with multiple NPIs
-- 3. Ranks organization types by their proportion of multiple-NPI facilities
-- 4. Presents results in descending order of complexity (% with multiple NPIs)

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Multiple NPIs indicate greater operational complexity
-- - Organization type and proprietary status are accurately reported
-- - Does not account for historical changes in NPI registration
-- - May not capture all forms of organizational complexity

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic analysis to identify regional variations in complexity
-- 2. Include temporal analysis to track changes in NPI patterns over time
-- 3. Correlate with facility size or service volume metrics
-- 4. Compare complexity patterns between urban and rural locations
-- 5. Analyze relationship between organizational complexity and Medicare participation

    - Additional Notes: This query focuses on organizational complexity patterns through NPI analysis, providing insights for operational planning and compliance monitoring. Note that the complexity metric is primarily based on NPI patterns and may not fully represent all aspects of organizational complexity. Results are most useful when combined with other operational metrics.
