-- Medicare Cost and Care Burden Analysis

-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyze the financial and care-related burdens faced by Medicare beneficiaries
-- to identify vulnerable populations and potential intervention opportunities.
-- This analysis helps inform policy decisions around benefit design and
-- support programs for high-risk beneficiaries.

-- How this works:
-- 1. Creates temp table of key burden indicators and demographics
-- 2. Calculates weighted percentages of beneficiaries facing different burdens
-- 3. Segments analysis by age and income groups
-- 4. Provides both sample counts and population estimates using survey weights

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Survey responses are accurate and representative
-- - Missing data is randomly distributed
-- - Recent years (2019+) reflect current conditions
-- - Analysis focused on financial and functional burden indicators

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic analysis using dem_cbsa
-- 2. Include health condition burden using hlt_oc* variables
-- 3. Analyze variations by insurance type (MA vs FFS)
-- 4. Create burden index combining multiple indicators
-- 5. Add temporal trends analysis across more years

    - Additional Notes: Query uses survey weights (puffwgt) to generate population-level estimates. Results are most reliable when segmented by no more than 2-3 demographic variables at a time due to sample size limitations. Data from years prior to 2019 may use slightly different variable definitions.
