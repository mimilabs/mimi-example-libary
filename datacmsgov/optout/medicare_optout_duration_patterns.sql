-- Title: Medicare Provider Opt-Out Duration and Renewal Pattern Analysis

-- Business Purpose:
-- This query analyzes the patterns of Medicare opt-out duration and renewal behaviors
-- among healthcare providers. Understanding how long providers stay opted out and their
-- renewal patterns helps:
-- 1. Project future provider availability for Medicare patients
-- 2. Identify trends in provider engagement with Medicare
-- 3. Support capacity planning and network adequacy assessments
-- 4. Inform policy decisions around opt-out requirements

    ROUND((providers_with_renewals * 100.0 / provider_count), 1) as renewal_rate_pct,
    ROUND((long_term_optouts * 100.0 / provider_count), 1) as long_term_optout_pct

-- How the Query Works:
-- 1. First CTE (opt_out_metrics) aggregates provider-level metrics including first opt-out date,
--    latest end date, number of opt-outs, and total duration
-- 2. Second CTE (duration_categories) groups these metrics by specialty and calculates key
--    statistics about renewal patterns and durations
-- 3. Final SELECT creates a summary report focusing on the most represented specialties

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- 1. Assumes consecutive opt-out periods for the same provider are intentional renewals
-- 2. Limited to currently active opt-out records
-- 3. Minimum threshold of 10 providers per specialty for meaningful analysis
-- 4. Does not account for gaps between opt-out periods

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add temporal analysis to show how renewal patterns change over time
-- 2. Include geographic factors to identify regional variations in opt-out duration
-- 3. Correlate opt-out duration with provider characteristics or market factors
-- 4. Add year-over-year comparison of opt-out duration patterns
-- 5. Include analysis of gaps between opt-out periods for insight into intermittent participation/*

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on opt-out duration metrics and renewal patterns, which could be sensitive to data quality issues at period boundaries. Consider adding date range parameters for more targeted analysis. Performance may be impacted with very large datasets due to date calculations across multiple records.
