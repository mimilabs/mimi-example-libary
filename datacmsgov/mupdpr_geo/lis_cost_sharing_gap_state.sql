-- Title: Medicare Part D Low Income Subsidy Impact Analysis by Geography
-- 
-- Business Purpose:
-- This query analyzes the variation in beneficiary cost sharing between low-income subsidy (LIS)
-- and non-LIS beneficiaries across geographic regions. This helps identify potential access
-- disparities and evaluate the effectiveness of the LIS program in different states.
-- Understanding these patterns can inform policy decisions and targeted assistance programs.

WITH cost_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        prscrbr_geo_desc AS state,
        SUM(tot_benes) AS total_beneficiaries,
        SUM(lis_bene_cst_shr) AS total_lis_cost_share,
        SUM(nonlis_bene_cst_shr) AS total_nonlis_cost_share,
        SUM(tot_drug_cst) AS total_drug_cost,
        -- Calculate per-beneficiary metrics
        ROUND(SUM(lis_bene_cst_shr)/SUM(tot_benes), 2) AS avg_lis_cost_per_bene,
        ROUND(SUM(nonlis_bene_cst_shr)/SUM(tot_benes), 2) AS avg_nonlis_cost_per_bene
    FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.mupdpr_geo
    WHERE prscrbr_geo_lvl = 'State'  -- Focus on state-level analysis
    AND mimi_src_file_date = '2022-12-31'  -- Most recent year
    GROUP BY prscrbr_geo_desc
)

SELECT 
    state,
    total_beneficiaries,
    avg_lis_cost_per_bene,
    avg_nonlis_cost_per_bene,
    -- Calculate cost burden differential
    ROUND(avg_nonlis_cost_per_bene - avg_lis_cost_per_bene, 2) AS cost_sharing_gap,
    -- Calculate % of total cost covered by beneficiary cost sharing
    ROUND(100.0 * (total_lis_cost_share + total_nonlis_cost_share) / total_drug_cost, 1) 
        AS pct_beneficiary_cost_share
FROM cost_metrics
WHERE total_beneficiaries > 0
ORDER BY cost_sharing_gap DESC;

-- How the Query Works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to aggregate key cost metrics at the state level
-- 2. Calculates per-beneficiary cost sharing for both LIS and non-LIS populations
-- 3. Computes the gap between LIS and non-LIS cost sharing
-- 4. Shows the percentage of total drug costs borne by beneficiaries
--
-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes even distribution of drug types between LIS and non-LIS populations
-- - Does not account for differences in prescription patterns or drug choices
-- - State-level aggregation may mask important within-state variations
-- - Beneficiary counts under 11 are suppressed in source data
--
-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add trending analysis to show how cost sharing gaps change over time
-- 2. Include drug type analysis to see if gaps vary by therapeutic class
-- 3. Correlate with state-level socioeconomic indicators
-- 4. Add geographic region groupings for regional comparisons
-- 5. Include additional metrics like prescription volumes and total prescriber counts

    - Additional Notes: The query provides good insights into subsidy effectiveness but may need adjustment for states with high suppression rates. Consider adding data quality checks or filters if many states show null values due to beneficiary count suppressions. The cost sharing calculations assume complete data for both LIS and non-LIS populations.
