-- Title: Medicare Part D Prescriber Distribution and Therapeutic Drug Analysis

-- Business Purpose:
-- This query analyzes prescriber density and therapeutic drug categories across geographic regions
-- to identify potential access gaps and prescribing patterns in Medicare Part D.
-- The insights can help healthcare organizations and policymakers optimize provider networks
-- and ensure appropriate coverage of key therapeutic classes.

WITH prescriber_density AS (
  -- Calculate prescriber concentration and therapeutic drug coverage by state
  SELECT 
    prscrbr_geo_desc,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN antbtc_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN brnd_name END) as unique_antibiotic_drugs,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN antpsyct_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN brnd_name END) as unique_antipsychotic_drugs,
    SUM(tot_prscrbrs) as total_prescribers,
    SUM(tot_clms) as total_claims,
    ROUND(AVG(tot_clms * 1.0 / NULLIF(tot_prscrbrs, 0)), 1) as avg_claims_per_prescriber
  FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.mupdpr_geo
  WHERE prscrbr_geo_lvl = 'State' 
    AND mimi_src_file_date = '2022-12-31'  -- Most recent year
  GROUP BY prscrbr_geo_desc
)

SELECT 
  prscrbr_geo_desc as state,
  total_prescribers,
  total_claims,
  avg_claims_per_prescriber,
  unique_antibiotic_drugs,
  unique_antipsychotic_drugs,
  -- Calculate relative metrics for comparison
  ROUND(100.0 * total_prescribers / SUM(total_prescribers) OVER (), 2) as pct_total_prescribers,
  ROUND(100.0 * total_claims / SUM(total_claims) OVER (), 2) as pct_total_claims
FROM prescriber_density
WHERE total_prescribers > 0
ORDER BY total_prescribers DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- How the Query Works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to aggregate key metrics by state including prescriber counts and therapeutic drug coverage
-- 2. Calculates average claims per prescriber and unique drugs in key therapeutic classes
-- 3. Computes relative percentages for comparison across states
-- 4. Filters and sorts results to show top 20 states by prescriber count

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes 2022 as the most recent year of data
-- - Limited to state-level analysis (excludes territories and national totals)
-- - Does not account for population differences between states
-- - Averages may be skewed by outliers or varying practice patterns
-- - Only includes Medicare Part D claims, not full prescribing patterns

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trend analysis to track changes in prescriber distribution
-- 2. Include population-adjusted metrics using census data
-- 3. Add cost analysis dimensions to understand spending patterns
-- 4. Incorporate additional therapeutic classes or drug categories
-- 5. Create geographic clusters based on similar prescribing patterns
-- 6. Add benchmarking against national averages
-- 7. Include analysis of urban vs rural differences within states

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on provider network analytics by combining prescriber concentration metrics with therapeutic drug coverage analysis. Performance may be impacted with very large datasets due to window functions. Consider adding indexes on prscrbr_geo_lvl and mimi_src_file_date columns for optimization.
