-- Title: Opioid Prescribing Pattern Analysis Across Geographic Regions in Medicare Part D

-- Business Purpose: 
-- This query analyzes opioid prescription patterns across states to identify areas that may
-- need targeted intervention or monitoring for opioid prescribing practices. It specifically
-- examines the prevalence of long-acting opioids, total claims, and costs by state,
-- providing insights for public health initiatives and policy decisions.

WITH state_opioid_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        prscrbr_geo_desc,

        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN opioid_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN brnd_name END) as unique_opioids,
        SUM(CASE WHEN opioid_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN tot_clms END) as total_opioid_claims,
        SUM(CASE WHEN opioid_la_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN tot_clms END) as long_acting_claims,
        SUM(CASE WHEN opioid_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN tot_drug_cst END) as total_opioid_cost,
        -- Calculate percentages and rates
        ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN opioid_la_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN tot_clms END) * 100.0 / 
            NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN opioid_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN tot_clms END), 0), 2) as pct_long_acting

-- How it works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to calculate key opioid metrics by state
-- 2. Filters for state-level data from the most recent year
-- 3. Calculates various metrics including unique opioids prescribed, claim volumes, and costs
-- 4. Computes the percentage of long-acting opioid claims
-- 5. Presents results sorted by total claims volume

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes 2022 is the most recent year available
-- - Excludes Foreign Country and Unknown geographic categories
-- - Does not account for population differences between states
-- - Limited to Medicare Part D beneficiaries only
-- - Does not consider patient demographics or clinical indications

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trending analysis
-- 2. Include population adjustment factors
-- 3. Add comparison to national averages
-- 4. Incorporate beneficiary cost share analysis
-- 5. Add correlation with state-level opioid policies or regulations
-- 6. Include analysis of concurrent benzodiazepine prescriptions
-- 7. Add geographic clustering analysis
-- 8. Incorporate prescriber density metrics/*

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on state-level opioid prescribing patterns in Medicare Part D, with special attention to long-acting opioids. When running this analysis, users should verify the most recent year in mimi_src_file_date and may need to adjust the cost normalization factor (currently set to millions) based on their reporting needs. The analysis deliberately excludes territories and unknown locations to ensure data quality.
