/*** medicare_specialty_prescribing_patterns.sql ***

Business Purpose:
This analysis examines prescribing patterns across different medical specialties to:
1. Identify which specialties are driving prescription volume and costs
2. Support formulary management and specialty-specific intervention strategies
3. Guide provider education and outreach programs based on specialty-specific trends

The insights help payers and healthcare organizations optimize their specialty-specific
drug management programs and improve prescribing efficiency.

/*** 
How it works:
1. First CTE aggregates key metrics by specialty
2. Second CTE calculates per-provider metrics and ranks specialties
3. Final output shows top 20 specialties by total cost with comprehensive metrics

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Relies on accurate specialty coding in the source data
- Some providers may practice in multiple specialties
- Does not account for case mix or patient complexity
- Cost data includes all payer sources, not just Medicare
- Specialty classifications may vary by region/system

Possible Extensions:
1. Add geographic analysis to compare specialty patterns by state/region
2. Include drug class analysis to see what types of drugs drive specialty costs
3. Trend analysis across multiple years to track changing patterns
4. Add clinical outcome metrics when available
5. Compare Medicare vs non-Medicare utilization patterns by specialty

    - Additional Notes: Query provides valuable insights for healthcare administrators and policymakers by showing cost efficiency and resource utilization across medical specialties. Note that results may be skewed by specialties with small provider counts or those treating complex patient populations. Consider adding risk adjustment factors for more accurate specialty comparisons.
