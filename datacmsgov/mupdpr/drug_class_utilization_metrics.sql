-- Business Purpose: Analyze therapeutic drug class patterns to identify:
-- 1. Most frequently prescribed therapeutic categories
-- 2. Average costs and utilization metrics by drug class
-- 3. Variations in prescription patterns across regions
-- This supports:
--   - Formulary optimization
--   - Drug class utilization management
--   - Regional care pattern analysis
--   - Value-based care program design

-- How this works:
-- 1. Creates therapeutic classes using generic drug names
-- 2. Aggregates key metrics by class and state
-- 3. Rolls up to national level with key performance indicators
-- 4. Focuses on major drug classes for clarity

-- Assumptions and limitations:
-- 1. Simple therapeutic classification based on generic names
-- 2. Limited to 2022 data
-- 3. Excludes "Other" category for focus
-- 4. May not capture all drugs in each class
-- 5. State-level analysis assumes provider location represents patient population

-- Possible extensions:
-- 1. Add time trends by comparing multiple years
-- 2. Expand therapeutic classifications using more detailed drug categories
-- 3. Add geographic variation analysis
-- 4. Include seasonal prescription patterns
-- 5. Compare with disease prevalence data
-- 6. Add demographic analysis using age group metrics
-- 7. Incorporate quality metrics like adherence patterns

    - Additional Notes: Query creates simplified therapeutic drug classifications based on generic names and may need to be expanded with more comprehensive drug categorization rules for production use. Current version focuses on 5 major drug classes (statins, metformin, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and proton pump inhibitors) with aggregated utilization metrics.
