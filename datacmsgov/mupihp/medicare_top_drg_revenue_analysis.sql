Title: Medicare Inpatient Cost Analysis - High-Value DRGs by Provider
 
Business Purpose:
This analysis identifies the highest-value Medicare inpatient procedures (DRGs) based on 
total payment volume and average reimbursement. This information is valuable for:
- Hospital strategic planning and service line development
- Healthcare investors evaluating market opportunities
- Insurance companies analyzing cost variations
- Healthcare consultants benchmarking provider performance

/*
How it works:
1. First CTE calculates key financial metrics for each provider-DRG combination
2. Second CTE aggregates these metrics at the DRG level
3. Final query presents top 20 DRGs by total revenue with key volume and payment metrics

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Uses most recent year of data (2022)
- Excludes low-volume providers (<10 discharges)
- Revenue calculation assumes reported averages are representative
- Does not account for seasonal variations
- Limited to Medicare fee-for-service population

Possible Extensions:
1. Add year-over-year trend analysis
2. Include geographic analysis by state/region
3. Compare academic vs community hospitals
4. Add case mix index adjustments
5. Include quality metrics when available
6. Analyze variation in charges vs payments
7. Add provider specialization analysis

    - Additional Notes: Query filters for procedures with >$1M total revenue and minimum 10 discharges per provider. Results show top 20 DRGs by total revenue with average payments and provider counts. Financial metrics are from 2022 Medicare fee-for-service claims only. Consider local market conditions and facility characteristics when interpreting results.
