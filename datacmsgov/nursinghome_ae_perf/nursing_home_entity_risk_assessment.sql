-- Nursing Home Quality Risk Assessment Query
-- 
-- Business Purpose: 
-- This query identifies high-risk nursing home affiliated entities by analyzing key quality 
-- and safety metrics. It helps healthcare organizations, regulators, and investors identify 
-- entities that may require additional oversight or intervention.
--
-- Key metrics analyzed:
-- - Overall star ratings
-- - Abuse indicators
-- - Special focus facility status
-- - Staff turnover
-- - Critical quality measures

--
-- How this query works:
-- 1. Selects key performance indicators for nursing home affiliated entities
-- 2. Calculates a simple risk score based on star ratings, abuse citations, and special focus status
-- 3. Filters for entities with 5+ facilities to focus on larger organizations
-- 4. Ranks results by risk score and size
--
-- Assumptions and limitations:
-- - Assumes current data is representative of ongoing performance
-- - Simple risk scoring may not capture all nuances of quality issues
-- - Does not account for regional variations or facility mix
-- - Limited to entities with 5+ facilities
--
-- Possible extensions:
-- 1. Add trend analysis by comparing against previous periods
-- 2. Include financial penalties and enforcement actions in risk scoring
-- 3. Add geographic analysis of high-risk entities
-- 4. Create separate risk scores for quality, safety, and staffing
-- 5. Add COVID-19 vaccination compliance metrics
--
-- This query serves as a starting point for identifying potentially problematic 
-- nursing home organizations that may require additional scrutiny or intervention./*

    - Additional Notes: Query scores and ranks nursing home affiliated entities based on quality metrics, abuse indicators, and oversight status. Risk scoring methodology is simplified for demonstration and may need adjustment based on specific organizational priorities. Minimum facility threshold of 5 may need to be adjusted depending on market analysis needs.
