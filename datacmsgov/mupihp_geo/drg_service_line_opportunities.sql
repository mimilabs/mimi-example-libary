-- 
-- Business Purpose: Identify service line growth opportunities by analyzing DRG volumes,
-- reimbursement rates, and payment gaps across geographies to guide strategic planning.
-- This helps healthcare organizations and consultants evaluate market opportunities and
-- optimize service line strategies.

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Extracts latest year's data for state-level DRG metrics
-- 2. Calculates payment ratio (reimbursement vs charges) 
-- 3. Ranks DRGs by volume within states and states by payment levels
-- 4. Identifies high-volume DRGs in states with favorable payments
--
-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Requires minimum volume threshold of 100 cases
-- - Based on Medicare FFS data only, not Medicare Advantage
-- - Does not account for cost of care delivery
-- - State-level analysis may mask local market variations
--
-- Possible Extensions:
-- - Add year-over-year volume growth analysis
-- - Include case mix index adjustments
-- - Compare to national averages/benchmarks
-- - Add demographic and competition metrics
-- - Integrate with cost-to-charge ratios
-- - Expand to service line groupers beyond individual DRGs/*

    - Additional Notes: Query identifies high-value service line opportunities by analyzing DRG volumes and payments at the state level. The minimum threshold of 100 discharges and focus on top 5 DRGs by volume helps ensure practical significance. Results are most useful for strategic planning and market assessment, though local market conditions should be considered for implementation.
