/*
Business Purpose: 
Analyze Medicare payment patterns and service volumes by provider gender to identify
potential gender-related disparities in reimbursement and practice patterns.
This analysis can inform:
- Healthcare equity initiatives
- Provider compensation benchmarking
- Practice pattern variations
- Workforce development strategies

The query examines average payments, service volumes, and specialty distributions
by provider gender for the most recent year of data.

How it works:
1. CTE calculates provider-level metrics grouped by gender and specialty
2. Main query aggregates to overall gender-level statistics
3. Includes both volume and payment metrics to provide comprehensive view
4. Uses weighted averages to account for service volume differences

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Limited to individual providers (excludes organizations)
- Gender data from NPPES may have gaps or inaccuracies
- Does not account for case mix or complexity differences
- Payment amounts affected by geographic adjustments
- Single year snapshot only

Possible Extensions:
1. Add year-over-year trend analysis
2. Break down by specific specialties of interest
3. Include geographic analysis by state/region
4. Compare facility vs non-facility settings
5. Add statistical testing for payment differences
6. Analyze specific high-volume procedures
7. Include case mix adjustment factors

    - Additional Notes: Query specifically focuses on gender-based disparities in Medicare service delivery and payments. Note that results will be most meaningful when combined with specialty-specific benchmarks and risk-adjusted outcomes data. The analysis excludes organizational providers and requires the gender field to be populated in the source data.
