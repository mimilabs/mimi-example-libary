Medicare Geographic Variation Analysis - Core Spending and Quality Metrics

Purpose: 
Analyzes key Medicare spending patterns and quality indicators across geographic 
regions to identify variations in healthcare costs and outcomes.

Business value:
- Identifies geographic variation in Medicare spending and care quality
- Highlights areas that may need targeted interventions
- Supports data-driven policy and resource allocation decisions

/*************************************************************************
How this query works:
1. Creates CTE with core state-level metrics for most recent year
2. Calculates rankings for key metrics
3. Returns ranked results ordered by per capita spending

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Focuses on state-level analysis only
- Uses standardized payments to control for geographic price differences
- Excludes states with very small Medicare populations
- Does not adjust for all population health differences

Possible Extensions:
1. Add year-over-year trend analysis
2. Include county-level geographic variation
3. Add demographic breakdowns
4. Incorporate quality metrics like PQI scores
5. Add statistical significance testing
6. Create peer groups based on population characteristics

    - Additional Notes: Query analyzes standardized Medicare spending and quality metrics at the state level, focusing on the most recent year's data. Results include rankings for costs, readmissions, and ER utilization. Minimum beneficiary threshold of 1000 applied to ensure statistical relevance. Geographic price differences are controlled through standardized payments, but other demographic and health status variations may impact comparisons.
