-- First-Time Provider Name Pattern Analysis
--
-- Business Purpose: 
-- Analyzes patterns in provider names for first-time Medicare enrollees to:
-- 1. Support provider outreach and communication strategies
-- 2. Identify potential cultural/demographic trends in new Medicare providers
-- 3. Help optimize enrollment processing workflows based on naming conventions
--
-- Note: This analysis can inform provider engagement strategies and
-- enrollment process optimization efforts.

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE with standardized provider names from the most recent data
-- 2. Calculates various statistics about name patterns grouped by last name initial
-- 3. Returns insights about name distributions and patterns
--
-- Assumptions and limitations:
-- - Assumes names are generally entered correctly and consistently
-- - Limited to basic name pattern analysis without cultural/ethnic classification
-- - Does not account for compound names or special characters
-- - Requires at least 5 providers per last name initial for meaningful analysis
--
-- Possible extensions:
-- 1. Add cultural/ethnic name analysis using reference data
-- 2. Compare name patterns across different time periods
-- 3. Cross-reference with specialty or geographic data if available
-- 4. Analyze common prefixes/suffixes in provider names
-- 5. Add support for handling international name formats

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on analyzing provider naming patterns for enrollment processing optimization. Requires sufficient data volume (minimum 5 providers per initial) for meaningful statistical analysis. Best used with recent data snapshots for current trends.
