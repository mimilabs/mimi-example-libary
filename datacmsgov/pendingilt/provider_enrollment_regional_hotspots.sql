-- Provider Enrollment Application Geographic Distribution Analysis
-- 
-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyzes the geographic concentration of pending Medicare provider enrollment applications
-- by examining NPI number patterns to identify potential regional enrollment bottlenecks
-- and support resource allocation decisions for application processing.
--
-- Created: 2024
-- Value Driver: Optimize provider enrollment processing efficiency and market access

  -- Extract the first 4 digits of NPI which correlate to geographic regions

-- How This Query Works:
-- 1. Groups applications by NPI prefix (geographic indicator)
-- 2. Calculates application volumes and provider counts per region
-- 3. Determines relative concentration of pending applications
-- 4. Ranks and filters to show top 10 regions by volume
--
-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- - NPI prefixes approximate geographic regions but aren't perfect
-- - Does not account for provider type differences
-- - Point-in-time snapshot only
-- - May include some data quality issues in NPI values
--
-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add time trending by incorporating _input_file_date
-- 2. Split analysis between physicians/non-physicians using name patterns
-- 3. Calculate processing volume targets by region
-- 4. Compare against historical approval rates by region
-- 5. Add geographic visualization capabilities
--
-- Business Value:
-- - Identifies geographic hotspots requiring additional processing resources
-- - Supports strategic workforce planning for enrollment operations
-- - Enables targeted outreach to high-volume regions
-- - Helps optimize contractor resource allocation/*

    - Additional Notes: This query focuses on geographic distribution patterns in Medicare provider enrollment applications using NPI number prefixes as regional indicators. While useful for high-level regional analysis, the accuracy depends on the correlation between NPI assignment patterns and actual geographic locations. Best used in conjunction with other geographic indicators for validation.
