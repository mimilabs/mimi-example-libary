-- Weekly Provider Enrollment Application Trend Analysis
--
-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyzes weekly trends in Medicare provider enrollment applications to support
-- capacity planning and identify potential bottlenecks in the enrollment process.
-- This insight helps Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) optimize staffing
-- and resource allocation for application processing.

WITH weekly_counts AS (
    -- Get weekly application volumes by provider type
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('week', _input_file_date) as week_start,
        -- Classify as physician based on naming patterns (Dr., MD, etc.)
        CASE 
            WHEN first_name LIKE 'Dr.%' OR last_name LIKE '%, MD' THEN 'Physician'
            ELSE 'Non-Physician'
        END as provider_type,
        COUNT(DISTINCT npi) as pending_applications
    FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.pendingilt
    GROUP BY 1, 2
),

week_over_week AS (
    -- Calculate week-over-week changes
    SELECT 
        week_start,
        provider_type,
        pending_applications,
        LAG(pending_applications) OVER (PARTITION BY provider_type ORDER BY week_start) as prev_week_applications,
        ((pending_applications * 1.0 - LAG(pending_applications) OVER (PARTITION BY provider_type ORDER BY week_start)) / 
         LAG(pending_applications) OVER (PARTITION BY provider_type ORDER BY week_start) * 100) as pct_change
    FROM weekly_counts
)

SELECT 
    week_start,
    provider_type,
    pending_applications as current_week_pending,
    prev_week_applications as previous_week_pending,
    ROUND(pct_change, 1) as week_over_week_pct_change
FROM week_over_week
WHERE week_start >= DATEADD(month, -3, CURRENT_DATE()) -- Last 3 months only
ORDER BY week_start DESC, provider_type;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Groups pending applications by week and provider type (physician/non-physician)
-- 2. Calculates week-over-week volume changes and percentage differences
-- 3. Focuses on recent 3 months of data for actionable insights
-- 4. Results show trending patterns that can inform resource planning

-- Assumptions and limitations:
-- - Provider type classification is based on name patterns which may not be 100% accurate
-- - Weekly counts may be affected by holidays or system downtimes
-- - Does not account for application complexity or processing time requirements
-- - Limited to basic volume metrics without quality or outcome measures

-- Possible extensions:
-- 1. Add moving averages to smooth out weekly fluctuations
-- 2. Include seasonal adjustment factors based on historical patterns
-- 3. Add forecasting capabilities for future volume predictions
-- 4. Break down by MAC jurisdiction for regional planning
-- 5. Correlate with known policy changes or enrollment initiatives

    - Additional Notes: Weekly aggregation may need adjustment based on MAC processing schedules. Provider type classification through name patterns should be validated against actual enrollment form data if available. Consider local timezone settings when using date_trunc functions.
