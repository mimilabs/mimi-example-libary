-- Hospice Ownership Analysis

/*
 * Business Purpose:
 * The purpose of this query is to provide insights into the ownership structure of hospices in the United States.
 * By analyzing the distribution of individual versus organizational ownership, as well as the types of organizations that own
 * hospices, we can gain a better understanding of the hospice industry's landscape and potentially identify any notable trends or patterns.
 * This information can be valuable for researchers, policymakers, and healthcare administrators interested in the hospice care
 * ecosystem and its evolution over time.

/*
 * This query first groups the hospice ownership data by the `type_owner` column, which indicates whether the owner is an individual ("I") or an
 * organization ("O"). It then counts the number of hospices for each owner type and calculates the percentage of the total hospices that each
 * type represents.

 * The key business insights that can be derived from this query are:
 * 1. The distribution of individual versus organizational ownership among hospices in the United States.
 * 2. The relative prevalence of each owner type, which can help identify any potential dominance or imbalances in the hospice ownership landscape.

 * Assumptions and Limitations:
 * - The data represents a snapshot in time and may not capture changes in hospice ownership over time.
 * - The data does not provide detailed information about the specific types of organizations that own hospices (e.g., hospitals, private equity firms, etc.).
 * - The data is anonymized, so it is not possible to link the ownership information to other characteristics of the hospices or their performance.

 * Possible Extensions:
 * 1. Expand the analysis to examine the distribution of ownership types (e.g., corporation, LLC, non-profit) among the organizational owners.
 * 2. Investigate regional variations in the types of hospice ownership by grouping the data by geographic factors (e.g., state, census region).
 * 3. Correlate the ownership structure with other hospice characteristics, such as size, patient demographics, or quality of care metrics, to
 *    gain deeper insights into the potential relationships between ownership and hospice performance.
 * 4. Analyze changes in hospice ownership over time by incorporating data from multiple time periods and tracking any shifts in the
 *    ownership landscape.
