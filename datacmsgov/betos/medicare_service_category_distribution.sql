RBCS Service Category Analysis

Business Purpose:
This query analyzes the distribution of Medicare Part B services across major categories
to provide insights into the types of healthcare services being provided under Medicare.
The analysis helps healthcare administrators and policy makers understand service patterns
and resource allocation.

-- Main query analyzing service categories and their makeup
SELECT 
    -- Aggregate at the category level
    r.rbcs_cat,
    r.rbcs_cat_desc,
    -- Count distinct procedures/services
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.hcpcs_cd) as num_services,
    -- Calculate percentage of total services
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT r.hcpcs_cd) * 100.0 / 
          (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT hcpcs_cd) FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.betos),2) as pct_of_total,
    -- Show distribution of major vs other procedures
    COUNT(CASE WHEN r.rbcs_major_ind = 'M' THEN 1 END) as major_procedures,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN r.rbcs_major_ind = 'O' THEN 1 END) as other_procedures,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN r.rbcs_major_ind = 'N' THEN 1 END) as non_procedures
FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.betos r
WHERE r._input_file_date = '2022-12-31' -- Using most recent data
GROUP BY r.rbcs_cat, r.rbcs_cat_desc
ORDER BY num_services DESC;

/*
How it works:
- Aggregates Medicare Part B services at the category level
- Calculates service counts and percentages
- Breaks down procedures by major/other/non-procedure types
- Uses most recent data snapshot

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes _input_file_date='2022-12-31' represents current complete data
- Analysis is at category level only
- Does not account for service frequency/utilization
- Does not include cost/reimbursement data

Possible Extensions:
1. Add temporal analysis to show category changes over time
2. Include subcategory breakdown for specific categories of interest
3. Analyze family-level distributions within categories
4. Add filters for specific date ranges or procedure types
5. Cross-reference with other CMS data for cost analysis

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on the 2022 snapshot of Medicare Part B service categories. For real-world applications, users should verify the latest available _input_file_date and may need to adjust the date filter accordingly. The percentage calculations assume equal weighting of all services, regardless of utilization frequency or cost impact.
