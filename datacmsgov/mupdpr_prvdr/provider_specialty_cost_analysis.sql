-- Medicare Part D Provider Type and Cost Analysis
--
-- Business Purpose:
-- This query analyzes Medicare Part D prescribing patterns by provider specialty type,
-- focusing on understanding prescription volumes, total costs, and beneficiary demographics
-- across different provider specialties. The analysis helps identify key provider types
-- driving Part D utilization and costs, supporting network adequacy and cost management initiatives.

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Aggregates key prescribing metrics by provider specialty type
-- 2. Calculates per-provider and per-claim metrics
-- 3. Ranks specialties by both cost and claims volume
-- 4. Returns top 20 specialties by total drug cost
--
-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Uses most recent complete year of data (2022)
-- - Excludes providers with null specialty or zero claims
-- - Does not account for differences in practice patterns or patient mix
-- - Cost metrics include all components (ingredient cost, dispensing fee, etc.)
--
-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trend analysis by specialty
-- 2. Include generic vs brand prescribing rates by specialty
-- 3. Break down costs by beneficiary demographic segments
-- 4. Add geographic analysis by state or region
-- 5. Analyze variations in risk scores across specialties

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on cost and utilization patterns across provider specialties, making it particularly useful for healthcare network management and cost containment initiatives. Note that results may be skewed towards specialties with higher prescription volumes or more expensive medications. For meaningful trend analysis, the date filter should be adjusted based on the available data periods.
