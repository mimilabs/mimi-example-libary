Medicare Part D Provider Prescribing Pattern Analysis

This query analyzes key prescribing patterns and costs across providers in the Medicare Part D program.
It focuses on identifying high-volume prescribers and their associated costs, while also highlighting
specialty-specific trends.

Business Purpose:
- Identify providers with highest prescription volumes and costs
- Compare prescribing patterns across specialties
- Analyze brand vs generic prescribing behaviors
- Support provider performance monitoring and cost management initiatives

/*
How this query works:
1. Creates a CTE with key provider-level metrics including generic prescribing rates and cost metrics
2. Aggregates data by provider specialty to show prescribing patterns
3. Filters for latest year and meaningful sample sizes
4. Orders results by total prescription volume

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Uses 2022 data - would need to be updated for newer periods
- Excludes providers with zero claims
- Some specialty groups may be underrepresented due to minimum provider threshold
- Cost data includes all payer sources, not just Medicare's portion

Possible Extensions:
1. Add geographic analysis by state/region
2. Include trending over multiple years
3. Add opioid prescribing metrics
4. Compare providers within specialties to identify outliers
5. Analyze patterns by beneficiary demographics
6. Include quality metrics like generic prescribing rates

    - Additional Notes: This query requires the latest year's data (currently hardcoded to 2022) in the mupdpr_prvdr table. Performance may be impacted for datasets with millions of providers. Consider adding indexes on prscrbr_type and tot_clms if query performance is slow.
