-- CMS Clinic Group Practice Revalidation Analysis

/*
This Databricks SQL query demonstrates the core business value of the `mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.revalidation` table.

The table provides insights into the revalidation process for clinic group practices participating in the Medicare program. This information can be leveraged to:

1. Understand the distribution of revalidation due dates across different states and provider types.
2. Analyze trends in the reassignment of billing privileges between individual providers and clinic group practices.
3. Identify potential areas of risk or bottlenecks in the revalidation process.
4. Support strategic decision-making around provider enrollment and retention.

By combining this data with the `datacmsgov.pc_provider` table, users can further enrich the analysis to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the provider landscape and the factors influencing clinic group practice reassignments.

  group_due_date,
  COUNT(*) AS total_reassignments

GROUP BY group_state_code, group_legal_business_name, group_due_date
ORDER BY total_reassignments DESC;

/*
This query focuses on the core business value of the `revalidation` table by:

1. Selecting the key columns that provide insights into the revalidation process, such as the state, clinic group practice name, and revalidation due date.
2. Filtering the data to only include records where the `record_type` is 'Reassignment', as this represents the core use case of the table.
3. Grouping the data by the selected columns to get the total number of reassignments for each clinic group practice, state, and revalidation due date.
4. Ordering the results by the total number of reassignments in descending order to surface the most active clinic group practices.

This query can be used as a foundation for further extensions, such as:

- Analyzing the distribution of revalidation due dates across different states or provider types.
- Identifying trends in the number of reassignments over time or across different geographic regions.
- Investigating the relationship between the number of individual employer associations and the likelihood of reassignment.
- Combining the data with the `datacmsgov.pc_provider` table to enrich the analysis with additional provider-level information.

Assumptions and Limitations:
- The data in the `revalidation` table is a snapshot and may not represent the complete historical record of all clinic group practice reassignments.
- The table does not include detailed information about the specific services or financial arrangements involved in the reassignment process.
- The lack of real provider names and addresses in the table may limit the ability to directly contact or identify specific providers.
