/* 
Provider Revalidation Risk Assessment and Workforce Planning

This query analyzes Medicare provider revalidation patterns to:
1. Identify practices with high numbers of providers due for revalidation
2. Assess workforce concentration risk based on provider associations
3. Support strategic planning for compliance and staffing

Business Value:
- Proactive compliance management
- Resource allocation optimization
- Risk mitigation for provider network stability

/*
How it works:
1. Creates a summary by practice group aggregating key metrics
2. Calculates risk levels based on revalidation timing and provider relationships
3. Filters to meaningful practice sizes and sorts by urgency

Assumptions:
- Practices with 5+ providers represent meaningful operational units
- 90-day window is appropriate for revalidation planning
- Provider concentration risk correlates with employer associations

Limitations:
- Does not account for specialty-specific revalidation complexities
- Risk scoring is simplified and may need adjustment
- TBD dates are excluded from due date calculations

Possible Extensions:
1. Add geographic clustering analysis
2. Include specialty-specific risk factors
3. Trend analysis over time using mimi_src_file_date
4. Join with pc_provider for additional provider characteristics
5. Create state-level summaries for regional planning

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on Medicare practice groups requiring near-term revalidation attention. Risk scoring uses simplified thresholds (10+ providers due in 90 days = high risk) that may need adjustment based on organizational needs. The 5-provider minimum filter might need to be adjusted for smaller markets or rural areas.
