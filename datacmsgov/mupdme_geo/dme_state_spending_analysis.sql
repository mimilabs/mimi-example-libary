Medicare DME Geographic Analysis - Top Equipment Categories by State
**************************************************************************

Business Purpose:
- Analyze Medicare durable medical equipment (DME) spending patterns across states
- Identify highest-cost and most utilized equipment categories 
- Support geographic allocation of DME resources and budget planning

This analysis shows:
1. Total Medicare payments and services by state
2. Top equipment categories in each state
3. Average payment per service for comparison

/*************************************************************************
How this query works:
1. state_totals CTE aggregates key metrics by state
2. equipment_categories CTE finds the highest-spend equipment category
3. Final query joins these together to show top 10 states by spend

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Uses most recent year (2022) data only
- Groups by broad equipment categories rather than specific HCPCS codes
- Does not account for population differences between states
- Focuses on Medicare payments rather than submitted charges

Possible Extensions:
1. Add year-over-year trend analysis
2. Include per capita calculations using state populations
3. Break down by specific HCPCS codes rather than categories
4. Add geographic region groupings
5. Include supplier counts and concentration metrics
6. Analyze rental vs purchase patterns

    - Additional Notes: Query calculates total Medicare DME spending and service utilization by state, identifying top equipment categories. Requires access to the mupdme_geo table and assumes 2022 data is available. Results are limited to top 10 states by total spending. Payment calculations are based on average Medicare payment amounts multiplied by service counts.
