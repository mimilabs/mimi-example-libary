-- dme_equipment_utilization_patterns.sql

-- Business Purpose:
-- - Analyze patterns of DME utilization and service volume by equipment category 
-- - Identify equipment types with highest beneficiary usage and service frequency
-- - Support capacity planning and inventory management decisions
-- - Guide provider education and training programs based on equipment demand

-- Main Query
SELECT 
  rbcs_lvl,
  rbcs_desc,
  COUNT(DISTINCT hcpcs_cd) as unique_equipment_codes,
  SUM(tot_suplr_benes) as total_beneficiaries,
  SUM(tot_suplr_srvcs) as total_services,
  ROUND(SUM(tot_suplr_srvcs)/SUM(tot_suplr_benes), 2) as services_per_beneficiary,
  ROUND(SUM(tot_suplr_clms)/SUM(tot_suplr_benes), 2) as claims_per_beneficiary,
  COUNT(DISTINCT rfrg_prvdr_geo_cd) as states_with_usage

FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.mupdme_geo
WHERE mimi_src_file_date = '2022-12-31'  -- Most recent full year
  AND rfrg_prvdr_geo_lvl = 'State'  -- State-level analysis
  AND tot_suplr_benes > 10  -- Exclude low-volume suppressed records
  
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY total_beneficiaries DESC;

-- How it works:
-- 1. Groups DME equipment by BETOS category level and description
-- 2. Calculates key utilization metrics including beneficiary counts and service volumes
-- 3. Derives per-beneficiary usage rates for services and claims
-- 4. Shows geographic spread through state count where equipment is used
-- 5. Filters to most recent year and excludes privacy-suppressed low volumes

-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- - Assumes 2022 data is complete and representative
-- - Limited to state-level patterns, masking local variations
-- - Excludes suppressed beneficiary counts (< 11) which may impact totals
-- - Service counts may vary in definition across equipment types

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trend analysis
-- 2. Break down by rental vs purchase patterns
-- 3. Include cost metrics to analyze utilization vs spending
-- 4. Add seasonal/quarterly analysis of usage patterns
-- 5. Incorporate geographic region groupings for regional comparisons

    - Additional Notes: The query provides equipment utilization metrics that can be particularly valuable for inventory forecasting and capacity planning. Note that the services_per_beneficiary ratio may be skewed for equipment types that require frequent replacements or ongoing supplies. The state count metric helps identify which equipment categories have nationwide vs regional distribution patterns.
