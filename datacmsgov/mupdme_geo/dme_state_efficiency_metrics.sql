-- dme_quality_cost_assessment.sql

-- Business Purpose:
-- - Analyze the relationship between supplier volume and cost efficiency
-- - Identify states where DME services may benefit from economies of scale
-- - Support network optimization and value-based contracting decisions
-- - Inform strategies for improving cost-effectiveness while maintaining quality

-- Main Query
WITH supplier_metrics AS (

    AND rfrg_prvdr_geo_lvl = 'State' -- State-level analysis
    AND tot_suplr_benes > 10 -- Filter out suppressed beneficiary counts
  GROUP BY rfrg_prvdr_geo_desc
)

SELECT 
  rfrg_prvdr_geo_desc AS state,
  ROUND(avg_suppliers_per_bene, 3) AS suppliers_per_bene,
  ROUND(avg_cost_per_service, 2) AS avg_service_cost,
  ROUND(total_annual_spend/1000000, 2) AS total_spend_millions,
  total_benes_served,
  -- Calculate composite efficiency score
  ROUND((avg_cost_per_service * avg_suppliers_per_bene) / 
    (SELECT AVG(avg_cost_per_service * avg_suppliers_per_bene) FROM supplier_metrics), 2
  ) AS relative_efficiency_score

ORDER BY relative_efficiency_score ASC
LIMIT 20;

-- How it works:
-- 1. Creates temp table with key metrics per state
-- 2. Calculates efficiency indicators including suppliers per beneficiary and costs
-- 3. Computes relative efficiency score compared to national average
-- 4. Returns top 20 states ranked by efficiency

-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- - Uses suppliers per beneficiary as proxy for market efficiency
-- - Assumes higher volume generally leads to better cost efficiency
-- - Does not account for differences in patient demographics or case mix
-- - Limited to states with non-suppressed beneficiary counts

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trend analysis of efficiency metrics
-- 2. Include BETOS category breakdowns to identify specific service opportunities
-- 3. Incorporate quality metrics when available
-- 4. Add geographic groupings (e.g., census regions) for regional patterns
-- 5. Include analysis of standardized payment amounts for geographic cost adjustment

    - Additional Notes: Query calculates a composite efficiency score for each state based on supplier density and cost metrics. Best used for identifying states with optimal balance between provider accessibility and cost effectiveness. May need adjustment of efficiency score calculation based on specific business priorities. Excludes territories and unknown/foreign locations for more accurate domestic comparison.
