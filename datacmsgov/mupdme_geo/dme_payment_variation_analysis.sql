-- dme_service_standardization_impact.sql

-- Business Purpose:
-- - Analyze impact of Medicare payment standardization on DME reimbursement variations
-- - Identify services with largest pre/post standardization payment differences
-- - Support pricing strategy and reimbursement policy analysis
-- - Guide contracting decisions based on geographic payment variations

-- How the Query Works:
-- 1. Creates CTE to calculate payment metrics for each HCPCS code
-- 2. Computes average payments before/after standardization
-- 3. Calculates absolute payment differences and variation ratios
-- 4. Filters for high-volume services with significant payment variations
-- 5. Returns top 20 services by total volume meeting criteria

-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- - Assumes 2022 data is most current and complete
-- - Requires sufficient service volume for meaningful analysis
-- - Does not account for differences in patient demographics
-- - Geographic cost adjustments may have changed over time

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add trending analysis to show changes in payment variations over time
-- 2. Include BETOS categories to identify patterns by equipment type
-- 3. Compare urban vs rural payment differences
-- 4. Add supplier concentration metrics to analyze market dynamics
-- 5. Incorporate beneficiary demographics for deeper insights

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on geographic payment variations before and after Medicare standardization adjustments. Best used with complete annual datasets and requires sufficient service volume (>100 services) for meaningful results. Payment variation threshold of 20% can be adjusted based on analysis needs.
