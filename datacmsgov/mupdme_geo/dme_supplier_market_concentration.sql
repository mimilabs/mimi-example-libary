-- Business Purpose:
-- - Track key durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers' market concentration by geography
-- - Identify areas with potential competitive dynamics or consolidation concerns
-- - Support market entry and expansion strategy decisions
-- - Monitor supplier competitive landscape trends over time

-- How this works:
-- 1. Creates supplier_metrics CTE to aggregate key volume and payment metrics by state
-- 2. Calculates average supplier size metrics to understand typical supplier scale
-- 3. Derives market concentration ratios to identify potentially consolidated markets
-- 4. Orders results by total Medicare payments to focus on largest markets first

-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- - Uses supplier counts as proxy for market competition (limitations with parent/subsidiary relationships)
-- - Averages may mask significant size variations between suppliers
-- - Geographic markets may cross state boundaries
-- - Suppressed beneficiary counts (<11) may affect metrics in smaller markets

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trend analysis to track market evolution
-- 2. Break out metrics by equipment category to identify segment-specific patterns
-- 3. Calculate Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) equivalent metrics where possible
-- 4. Add demographic factors to identify underserved markets
-- 5. Compare market concentration with reimbursement rates or quality metrics

    - Additional Notes: Query analyzes Medicare DME market structure through supplier density and payment distribution metrics. Best used for initial market assessment but should be complemented with detailed supplier-level data for complete competitive analysis. Payment calculations assume no data suppression.
