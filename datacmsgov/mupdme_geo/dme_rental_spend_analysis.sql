-- supplier_rental_cost_analysis.sql 

-- Business Purpose:
-- - Analyze cost differences between rental vs purchase equipment across geographies
-- - Identify opportunities for cost optimization in DME rental arrangements
-- - Support negotiations with suppliers and rental policy decisions
-- - Enable data-driven recommendations for optimal rental vs purchase decisions

/* How it works:
- Aggregates DME utilization and cost metrics by geography, rental status, and equipment category
- Calculates key financial metrics including total spend and payment ratios
- Filters for material spending levels and significant service volumes
- Enables comparison of rental vs purchase arrangements across states

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Uses 2022 data as representative period
- Excludes low-volume products/services that may still be strategically important
- Does not account for length of rental periods or equipment lifecycle costs
- Medicare payment patterns may differ from commercial insurance

Possible Extensions:
1. Add year-over-year trending analysis to identify shifting rental patterns
2. Include detailed HCPCS code analysis for specific equipment types
3. Calculate potential savings from rental-to-purchase conversion
4. Compare state variations in rental prevalence for similar equipment
5. Analyze supplier concentration in rental vs purchase arrangements

    - Additional Notes: Query provides comparative view of rental vs purchase spending for durable medical equipment across states, but doesn't account for rental duration or long-term cost-effectiveness. Best used with additional context about typical rental periods and equipment lifecycles.
