How this query works:

1. The main query aggregates the number of home health agencies by the type of owner
   (individual or organization) using the `type_owner` column.
2. The `COUNT(DISTINCT enrollment_id)` aggregates the number of unique home health
   agencies, as each enrollment_id represents a distinct agency.
3. The `CASE` statement is used to convert the short 'I' and 'O' codes into
   more descriptive labels for the owner type.
4. The results are ordered by the number of agencies descending, so the most
   common owner type is displayed first.

Assumptions and limitations:

- The data only includes home health agencies that participate in the Medicare program,
  and may not be representative of all home health agencies in the United States.
- The data does not contain any personally identifiable information about the owners,
  so the analysis is limited to the organizational level.
- The data represents a snapshot in time and does not reflect changes in ownership
  over time.

Possible extensions:

- Analyze the distribution of owner types by geographic region or other
  agency characteristics to identify potential patterns or trends.
- Investigate the relationship between ownership structure and agency performance
  metrics, such as quality of care, patient outcomes, or financial measures.
- Explore potential conflicts of interest or other issues related to the
  ownership of home health agencies by individuals or organizations with
  other healthcare interests.
- Track changes in ownership structure over time to understand the factors
  driving consolidation or diversification in the home health industry.
