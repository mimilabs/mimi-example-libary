Geographic Distribution Analysis of Medicare Home Infusion Therapy Providers

Business Purpose:
This query analyzes the geographic distribution of Medicare-enrolled home infusion 
therapy providers to understand service coverage and identify potential gaps in access. 
This information is valuable for:
- Healthcare planning and resource allocation
- Identifying underserved areas
- Supporting expansion decisions for healthcare organizations

-- Main query to get provider counts and distributions by state
SELECT 
    -- Location identifiers
    state,
    COUNT(*) as provider_count,
    
    -- Calculate percentage of total providers
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as pct_of_total,
    
    -- Get count of unique counties served
    COUNT(DISTINCT state_county_name) as counties_served,
    
    -- Calculate providers per county ratio
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT state_county_name), 2) as providers_per_county

FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.pc_homeinfusion

-- Get most recent data snapshot
WHERE mimi_src_file_date = (
    SELECT MAX(mimi_src_file_date) 
    FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.pc_homeinfusion
)

GROUP BY state
ORDER BY provider_count DESC;

/*
How the Query Works:
1. Selects the most recent data using mimi_src_file_date
2. Groups providers by state
3. Calculates key metrics:
   - Total providers per state
   - Percentage distribution
   - County coverage
   - Provider density per county

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Uses most recent data snapshot only
- Assumes one record per unique provider
- Does not account for provider capacity or service area radius
- County-level analysis may not reflect true accessibility

Possible Extensions:
1. Add geographic clustering analysis:
   - ZIP code level distribution
   - Urban vs rural comparison
   
2. Enhance with demographic data:
   - Medicare population density
   - Age distribution correlation
   
3. Time-series analysis:
   - Provider count trends
   - Service area expansion/contraction
   
4. Service accessibility metrics:
   - Distance to nearest provider
   - Population coverage estimates

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on state-level distribution metrics but requires sufficient memory for window functions when calculating percentages across the full dataset. Results are limited to the most recent snapshot date and may need adjustment if analyzing historical trends.
