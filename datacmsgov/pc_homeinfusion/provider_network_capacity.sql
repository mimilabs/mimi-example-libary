-- Home Infusion Therapy Provider Network Analysis
--
-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyzes potential network adequacy by examining the ratio of providers 
-- to Medicare beneficiaries in each state, helping identify areas that may
-- need additional coverage or support for home infusion therapy services.
--
-- This analysis supports:
-- - Network development strategies
-- - Market expansion planning
-- - Access to care assessments

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to count unique providers and counties served per state
-- 2. Joins with estimated Medicare population data using state codes
-- 3. Calculates key ratios for network adequacy assessment
-- 4. Orders results by beneficiaries per provider to highlight potential coverage gaps

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Medicare beneficiary counts are placeholder values for select states
-- - Does not account for provider capacity or service types
-- - Assumes even distribution of beneficiaries within states
-- - Does not consider geographic barriers or travel times
-- - Counties without providers may not be identified

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add actual Medicare beneficiary data by state
-- 2. Include provider capacity metrics if available
-- 3. Add year-over-year trend analysis
-- 4. Incorporate drive time analysis for accessibility
-- 5. Add demographic risk factors by region
-- 6. Include specialty service type analysis
-- 7. Add competitor analysis for market share assessment

    - Additional Notes: Query uses placeholder Medicare beneficiary data for demonstration. For production use, replace the medicare_population CTE with actual beneficiary data from authoritative source. Results are most meaningful when analyzing states with complete beneficiary count data (CA, FL, TX, NY, PA in current version).
