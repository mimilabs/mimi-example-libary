-- CMS Data Catalog Exploration

-- This query explores the business value of the `datacatalog` table in the `datacmsgov` schema.
-- The `datacatalog` table provides a comprehensive catalog of datasets available on the data.cms.gov website,
-- which is a valuable resource for researchers and analysts studying healthcare-related data.

-- The query focuses on understanding the types of datasets available, their access levels, and update frequencies.
-- This information can help users identify datasets that are relevant to their research and understand
-- the timeliness and accessibility of the data.

SELECT
  accessLevel,                 -- The level of access granted to the dataset
  accrualPeriodicity,          -- The frequency with which the dataset is updated
  COUNT(*) AS dataset_count    -- The number of datasets with each access level and update frequency
FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.datacatalog
GROUP BY accessLevel, accrualPeriodicity
ORDER BY dataset_count DESC;

-- This query provides a high-level overview of the datasets in the CMS data catalog,
-- including the distribution of access levels (public vs. restricted) and update frequencies.
-- The results can help users understand the types of data available and how frequently the
-- datasets are updated, which is important for determining the relevance and timeliness of the data.

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - The `datacatalog` table only provides metadata about the datasets, not the actual data.
-- - The access levels and update frequencies reported may change over time as the datasets are updated.
-- - The query does not provide information about the specific content or subject areas of the datasets.

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Analyze the distribution of datasets across different bureaus or agencies within CMS.
-- 2. Investigate the relationship between access level, update frequency, and dataset subject area.
-- 3. Explore trends in the number and types of datasets available in the catalog over time.
-- 4. Provide links or summaries of the datasets with the highest update frequencies or most public access.
