-- DME Provider Spending and Utilization Analysis
-- 
-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyze high-volume DME prescribers and their associated costs to:
-- 1. Identify opportunities for cost optimization
-- 2. Detect potential outliers in prescribing patterns
-- 3. Support provider network management decisions
-- 4. Guide medical policy and coverage decisions

-- Select data for latest available year (2022)

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to aggregate key metrics by provider specialty
-- 2. Calculates total services and payments using the volume * average amount pattern
-- 3. Computes per-provider averages to normalize across specialties
-- 4. Filters and sorts to show highest-impact specialties

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes 2022 data is available and complete
-- - Aggregates across all DME types and geographic regions
-- - Does not account for severity/complexity of patient populations
-- - Payment amounts don't reflect final settlements or adjustments

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic analysis by state/region
-- 2. Break down by specific HCPCS codes within each specialty
-- 3. Compare rental vs non-rental utilization patterns
-- 4. Add year-over-year trend analysis
-- 5. Include analysis of submitted charges vs allowed amounts to assess charging practices
-- 6. Add provider demographics (gender, urban/rural) analysis/*

    - Additional Notes: Query aggregates Medicare DME spending and utilization by provider specialty for the most recent year (2022). Results are limited to specialties with 10+ providers to ensure statistical relevance. Payment calculations use volume * average methodology which may differ slightly from actual totals due to rounding.
