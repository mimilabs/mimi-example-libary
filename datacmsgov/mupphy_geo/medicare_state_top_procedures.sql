-- medicare_geo_hcpcs_service_analysis.sql
-- Business Purpose: Analyze geographic variations in high-volume Medicare services to identify
-- potential market opportunities and care delivery optimization targets. This analysis helps
-- healthcare organizations understand regional differences in service delivery patterns and
-- associated costs for strategic planning and resource allocation.

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE that ranks procedures within each state by total beneficiaries
-- 2. Calculates key utilization metrics including services per beneficiary and provider density
-- 3. Returns the top 5 highest-volume procedures for each state with associated metrics
-- 4. Focuses on both utilization patterns and economic measures

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Uses most recent year's data (2022)
-- - State-level analysis only; does not include territory or national-level data
-- - Rankings based on beneficiary volume rather than costs or other metrics
-- - Assumes procedures with highest beneficiary counts represent key market opportunities

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trend analysis to identify growing/declining procedures
-- 2. Include provider specialty mix analysis for key procedures
-- 3. Compare procedure costs across states to identify pricing variations
-- 4. Add filters for specific procedure types or place of service
-- 5. Calculate market concentration metrics using provider counts
-- 6. Analyze correlation between provider density and utilization patterns

    - Additional Notes: Query provides state-by-state analysis of highest-volume Medicare procedures with key utilization and economic metrics. Useful for market analysis and strategic planning but limited to 2022 data and state-level aggregation. Consider memory usage when running across all states due to the window functions.
