/*
How the query works:
1. The query aggregates the data by provider specialty (`rndrng_prvdr_type`) to provide a high-level overview of the key metrics.
2. It calculates the number of unique providers, total beneficiaries served, total services provided, total Medicare allowed and payment amounts, average beneficiary age, and average beneficiary risk score.
3. The results are ordered by the total Medicare allowed amount in descending order to identify the top specialties in terms of Medicare spending.

Assumptions and Limitations:
- The query assumes that the latest data year (2022-12-31) is the most relevant for analysis.
- The analysis is limited to the provider-level data and does not consider individual patient-level information or longitudinal trends.
- The query does not account for potential data suppression or other limitations described in the table description.

Possible Extensions:
1. Analyze the data by geographic region (e.g., state, RUCA code) to identify regional variations in provider characteristics and healthcare utilization.
2. Investigate the relationship between provider characteristics (e.g., credentials, experience) and the quality and cost of care delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.
3. Explore the impact of beneficiary demographics (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, risk scores) on healthcare utilization patterns and costs at the provider level.
4. Identify potential outliers or patterns of potential fraud, waste, or abuse in the Medicare program using the provider-level data.
5. Develop predictive models to forecast healthcare utilization and costs based on the provider-level data and inform policy decisions around provider payment and incentive structures.
