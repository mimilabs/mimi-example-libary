-- Medicare Demographics and Health Needs Analysis
-- Business Purpose: This query analyzes demographic patterns and health needs across the Medicare population to:
-- 1. Identify high-priority population segments for targeted care management and support services
-- 2. Support strategic planning for healthcare delivery program design
-- 3. Guide resource allocation and service accessibility improvements

-- How this works:
-- 1. First CTE establishes core demographic and health status indicators
-- 2. Second CTE calculates key population segment metrics
-- 3. Final select formats results for analysis with calculated percentages

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Relies on survey weights for population representation
-- - Limited to most recent years for current relevance
-- - Aggregated view may mask individual variation
-- - Survey response bias may affect results

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic analysis by census region
-- 2. Include healthcare utilization patterns
-- 3. Analyze trends over longer time periods
-- 4. Add cost and coverage type dimensions
-- 5. Create risk scoring based on multiple factors

    - Additional Notes: Query provides weighted population segment analysis with key health indicators. Best for year-over-year demographic trend analysis and identification of high-needs beneficiary groups. Note that sample weights must be properly interpreted for accurate population-level conclusions.
