Title: Medicare Beneficiary Drug Coverage Analysis - Core Metrics
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes key metrics around Medicare prescription drug coverage and 
beneficiary experiences to help:
1. Assess beneficiary satisfaction and understanding of drug coverage
2. Identify potential access and affordability issues
3. Evaluate medication adherence behaviors

/*******************************************************************************
HOW IT WORKS:
- Creates summary metrics for each survey year around key drug coverage dimensions
- Uses CASE statements to calculate percentages while handling missing/invalid data
- NULLIFs prevent division by zero errors
- ROUNDs results to 1 decimal place for readability

ASSUMPTIONS & LIMITATIONS:
- Assumes response codes are consistent across years
- Excludes "Don't know"/"Refused" from percentage calculations
- Does not account for survey weights
- Simple counts may not reflect true population statistics

POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS:
1. Add demographic breakdowns (age, income, health status)
2. Include trend analysis across years
3. Incorporate survey weights for population-level estimates  
4. Add regional comparisons
5. Cross-reference with health outcomes

    - Additional Notes: The query creates a high-level dashboard of Medicare prescription drug coverage metrics focusing on beneficiary experience, affordability challenges, and medication adherence behaviors. Note that the percentages calculated do not incorporate survey weights (PUFSWGT), which would be necessary for true population-representative estimates.
