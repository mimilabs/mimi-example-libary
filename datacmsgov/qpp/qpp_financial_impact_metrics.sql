-- QPP Financial Impact Assessment
-- Business Purpose: Analyze the financial implications of QPP participation by examining 
-- payment adjustments, allowed charges, and performance scores to help practices 
-- optimize their value-based care strategy and revenue potential.

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to aggregate financial and performance metrics by state, practice size, and clinician type
-- 2. Calculates key metrics including average charges, payment adjustments, and final scores
-- 3. Estimates total financial impact by multiplying allowed charges by payment adjustment percentage
-- 4. Provides per-provider impact analysis to identify most affected segments

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes payment_adjustment_percentage is stored as actual percentage (e.g., 2.0 means 2%)
-- - Excludes non-reporting providers and those with zero allowed charges
-- - Limited to groups with 10+ providers for statistical reliability
-- - Does not account for timing differences in measurement and payment years

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trend analysis to track financial impact changes
-- 2. Include quality and cost category scores to correlate with financial outcomes
-- 3. Analyze impact of special statuses (rural, HPSA) on financial performance
-- 4. Compare financial impact across different participation options
-- 5. Add risk adjustment based on patient complexity factors

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on financial ROI metrics for QPP participation. Requires sufficient data volume (10+ providers per group) for reliable analysis. Payment impact calculations are estimates based on reported allowed charges and adjustment percentages. Consider local regulations and payment rules when interpreting results.
