Title: QPP Provider Performance Analysis - Core Business Insights
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes key performance metrics from the Quality Payment Program (QPP)
to identify patterns in provider participation and performance across different
practice characteristics. These insights help:
1. Evaluate effectiveness of value-based care programs
2. Identify areas needing support/improvement
3. Track provider engagement and outcomes

/*
How it works:
1. Creates base metrics CTE to aggregate key performance indicators
2. Calculates averages for core QPP measures
3. Adds participation rate calculation
4. Filters for groups with meaningful sample sizes
5. Orders by provider volume and performance

Assumptions/Limitations:
- Focuses on providers with final scores (completed reporting)
- Minimum threshold of 10 providers per group for statistical relevance
- Assumes current data reflects accurate performance metrics
- Limited to top 100 results for initial analysis

Possible Extensions:
1. Add year-over-year trend analysis
2. Include geographic analysis (rural/urban, HPSA status)
3. Expand to compare performance across different measure types
4. Add statistical significance testing
5. Include cost and improvement activities scores
6. Analyze impact of practice characteristics on performance

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on provider-level QPP performance metrics and requires sufficient data volume (10+ providers per group) for meaningful analysis. Performance calculations exclude providers with null final scores. Results are limited to top 100 groups by provider count and performance score.
