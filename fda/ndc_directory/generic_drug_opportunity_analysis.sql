-- Title: Strategic Generic Drug Launch Opportunities Analysis

-- Business Purpose:
-- This analysis helps identify potential opportunities for generic drug development
-- by examining drug products approaching their listing expiration dates or end of marketing.
-- Key insights include:
-- - Products with imminent listing expirations
-- - Market gaps in therapeutic categories
-- - Identification of brand products without generic alternatives
-- - Manufacturer concentration in specific drug categories

WITH upcoming_expirations AS (
  SELECT 
    generic_name,
    brand_name,
    marketing_category,
    manufacturer_name,
    listing_expiration_date,
    marketing_end_date,
    dosage_form,
    COUNT(*) as product_count
  FROM mimi_ws_1.fda.ndc_directory
  WHERE 
    -- Focus on products approaching expiration in next 12 months
    listing_expiration_date BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE AND DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE, 365)
    -- Exclude already discontinued products
    AND (marketing_end_date IS NULL OR marketing_end_date > CURRENT_DATE)
    -- Focus on NDA/ANDA products
    AND marketing_category IN ('NDA', 'ANDA', 'BLA')
  GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
),

market_opportunity AS (
  SELECT
    generic_name,
    brand_name,
    marketing_category,
    manufacturer_name,
    listing_expiration_date,
    marketing_end_date,
    dosage_form,
    product_count,
    -- Calculate days until expiration
    DATEDIFF(listing_expiration_date, CURRENT_DATE) as days_to_expiration,
    -- Flag if no generic exists
    CASE WHEN marketing_category = 'NDA' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as potential_generic_opportunity
  FROM upcoming_expirations
)

SELECT 
  generic_name,
  brand_name,
  marketing_category,
  manufacturer_name,
  listing_expiration_date,
  days_to_expiration,
  dosage_form,
  product_count,
  potential_generic_opportunity
FROM market_opportunity
ORDER BY days_to_expiration ASC, product_count DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- How the Query Works:
-- 1. Identifies drug products approaching listing expiration in next 12 months
-- 2. Filters out discontinued products and focuses on FDA-approved drugs
-- 3. Groups by key product attributes to understand market concentration
-- 4. Calculates time to expiration and flags potential generic opportunities
-- 5. Orders results by urgency (days to expiration) and market size (product count)

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes listing expiration dates are accurately maintained
-- - Does not account for patent protection status
-- - Market size estimation is based on product count only
-- - Does not consider pricing or revenue data
-- - Limited to FDA-approved products only

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add active ingredient analysis to identify complex drug opportunities
-- 2. Include therapeutic classification to assess market segments
-- 3. Incorporate historical generic conversion success rates
-- 4. Add market size estimates from external data sources
-- 5. Include patent expiration data if available
-- 6. Add competitive intensity metrics by therapeutic area

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on near-term market opportunities in the generic drug space by analyzing listing expirations and market gaps. Results are most relevant for pharmaceutical companies, market analysts, and strategic planners evaluating generic drug development opportunities. The 365-day window for expiration analysis can be adjusted based on strategic planning horizons.
