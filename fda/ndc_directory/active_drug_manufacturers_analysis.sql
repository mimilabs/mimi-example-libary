Title: Active Drug Products Market Analysis

Business Purpose:
This query analyzes currently marketed drug products to provide insights into:
- Distribution across manufacturers
- Product types and dosage forms
- Controlled substance classifications
- Marketing status

This information helps stakeholders understand:
- Market concentration and competition
- Product diversity and availability 
- Regulatory compliance landscape

/*
How it works:
1. CTE filters to currently marketed products
2. Main query aggregates by manufacturer
3. Provides counts and breakdowns of key product attributes
4. Limits to manufacturers with 5+ products

Key Changes:
- Replaced STRING_AGG with COLLECT_SET since we're using Spark SQL
- COLLECT_SET returns array of distinct values

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes marketing_end_date accurately reflects market availability
- Limited to top 100 manufacturers by product count
- Groups all dosage forms/types together which may mask important distinctions
- Does not account for market share or sales volumes

Possible Extensions:
1. Add time-based analysis of product launches/discontinuations:
   - Add marketing_start_date trends
   - Compare historical vs current product counts

2. Enhance product categorization:
   - Break out prescription vs OTC products
   - Analyze therapeutic categories
   - Group similar dosage forms

3. Add geographic analysis:
   - Link to facility location data
   - Analyze manufacturing site distribution

4. Incorporate associated tables:
   - Join to active ingredients for ingredient-level analysis
   - Include pharmaceutical classification details
   - Add RxCUI linkages for terminology mapping

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on manufacturers with 5+ products and uses COLLECT_SET to aggregate distinct values into arrays. Results are limited to top 100 manufacturers by product count. The analysis excludes discontinued products based on marketing_end_date.
