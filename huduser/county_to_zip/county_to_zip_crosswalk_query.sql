-- Title: County to ZIP Code Crosswalk Query

/*
Business Purpose:
The county_to_zip table provides a valuable resource for mapping between U.S. counties and ZIP codes. This data can be used to:

1. Analyze the distribution of ZIP codes across different counties in a given state.
2. Understand the proportion of residential, business, and other addresses within each county-ZIP code pair.
3. Identify counties with the highest number of associated ZIP codes.
4. Explore patterns and correlations between geographic location and ZIP code characteristics.
5. Track changes in the county-to-ZIP code mapping over time.
6. Leverage the crosswalk to improve the accuracy of geospatial analysis and data visualization projects.

The crosswalk data can be used to support a variety of business use cases, such as market analysis, customer segmentation, logistics planning, and more.

-- Main Query
SELECT
  county,
  zip,
  usps_zip_pref_city,
  usps_zip_pref_state,
  res_ratio,
  bus_ratio,
  oth_ratio,
  tot_ratio,
  mimi_src_file_date
FROM mimi_ws_1.huduser.county_to_zip
WHERE mimi_src_file_date = (
  SELECT MAX(mimi_src_file_date)
  FROM mimi_ws_1.huduser.county_to_zip
);

/*
How the Query Works:
1. The query selects the key columns from the county_to_zip table, including the county and ZIP code identifiers, the USPS preferred city and state names, and the various address ratios.
2. The WHERE clause filters the data to only include the most recent version of the crosswalk, based on the maximum mimi_src_file_date.
3. This allows users to analyze the current state of the county-to-ZIP code mapping and understand the latest distribution of addresses across the different geographic units.

Assumptions and Limitations:
- The county_to_zip table does not contain any personally identifiable information or sensitive data.
- The mapping between counties and ZIP codes is not always one-to-one, as a single ZIP code may span multiple counties, and a county may contain multiple ZIP codes.
- The data represents a snapshot of the county-to-ZIP code mapping at a specific point in time, so it may not reflect the most recent changes in ZIP code boundaries or county definitions.

Possible Extensions:
1. Analyze the distribution of ZIP codes across different counties in a given state by grouping the data by state and county.
2. Identify the counties with the highest number of associated ZIP codes by ordering the results by the number of unique ZIP codes per county.
3. Explore patterns and correlations between the geographic location of counties and the characteristics of their associated ZIP codes (e.g., preferred city names) by joining the county_to_zip data with other geospatial datasets.
4. Track changes in the county-to-ZIP code mapping over time by comparing the data across multiple years using the mimi_src_file_date or mimi_src_file_name columns.
5. Leverage the county-to-ZIP code crosswalk to improve the accuracy of geospatial analysis or data visualization projects by using the mapping to associate data points with their corresponding geographic units.
