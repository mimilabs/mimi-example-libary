This SQL query demonstrates the core business value of the `mimi_ws_1.huduser.zip_to_cbsa_mto` table, which provides a many-to-one mapping between 5-digit ZIP codes and Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs).

The table can be used to:
1. Analyze the demographic characteristics of populations living in different CBSAs based on the ZIP codes they reside in.
2. Investigate the relationship between housing prices and the concentration of ZIP codes mapped to specific CBSAs.
3. Assess the impact of public policies or interventions implemented at the CBSA level on communities within specific ZIP codes.
4. Identify patterns of economic activity or industry clustering by examining the distribution of businesses across ZIP codes within CBSAs.
5. Study the geographic accessibility of healthcare services, educational institutions, or other amenities by analyzing the proximity of ZIP codes to different CBSAs.

/*
This query selects the key columns from the `mimi_ws_1.huduser.zip_to_cbsa_mto` table, including the ZIP code, CBSA code, city and state names, and the various address ratios. The `score` column indicates the confidence in the ZIP-CBSA mapping, with a value of 1 representing the highest confidence.

By filtering for only the highest confidence mappings (`z.score = 1`), we can ensure that the analysis is based on the most reliable data. The results are ordered by ZIP code and CBSA code to make it easier to explore the relationships between these geographic entities.

Assumptions and Limitations:
- The data represents a snapshot in time (as of March 20, 2024) and may not reflect changes in ZIP codes or CBSA definitions that occur after this date.
- The residential ratio used to determine the many-to-one mapping may not capture all nuances of the relationship between ZIP codes and CBSAs, such as commuting patterns or economic ties.
- In cases where there are ties in the residential ratio, the mapping is based on a random selection, which may not always reflect the most meaningful or relevant CBSA for a given ZIP code.

Possible Extensions:
1. Join the ZIP-CBSA mapping data with demographic or economic datasets to analyze the characteristics of populations living in different CBSAs.
2. Visualize the distribution of ZIP codes across CBSAs using a geographical information system (GIS) or data visualization tools.
3. Investigate the relationship between the address ratios (residential, business, other) and various metrics, such as housing prices, industry composition, or access to services.
4. Explore how changes in CBSA definitions or ZIP code boundaries over time could impact the analysis and insights derived from this data.
5. Develop models or algorithms to improve the many-to-one mapping between ZIP codes and CBSAs, considering factors beyond just the residential ratio.
