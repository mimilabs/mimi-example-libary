-- CBSA to Zip Code Crosswalk Analysis

/*
This query demonstrates the core business value of the `mimi_ws_1.huduser.cbsa_to_zip` table, which provides a crosswalk between Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) and USPS ZIP codes.

The main use cases for this table include:
1. Analyzing the distribution of residential, business, and other addresses across different geographic areas
2. Studying the relationship between CBSA-ZIP characteristics and socioeconomic indicators
3. Leveraging the crosswalk data to investigate the impact of local policies or interventions on specific regions
4. Combining the CBSA-ZIP data with other datasets to uncover spatial patterns and correlations

/*
This query retrieves the key columns from the `cbsa_to_zip` table, including the CBSA code, ZIP code, USPS preferred city and state, and the various address ratios (residential, business, other, and total).

The `WHERE` clause ensures that we are using the most recent data by selecting the rows with the maximum `mimi_src_file_date`.

The business value of this data is in its ability to provide a comprehensive view of the geographic distribution of addresses across different regions. This information can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

1. Analyzing population density and urbanization patterns: The `res_ratio` can be used to understand the concentration of residential addresses in different CBSAs and ZIP codes, which can inform urban planning and resource allocation decisions.

2. Investigating the relationship between address ratios and socioeconomic indicators: The address ratios can be combined with other datasets, such as income levels or housing prices, to study how they are correlated and how this relationship varies across geographic areas.

3. Evaluating the impact of local policies or interventions: By using the CBSA to ZIP code crosswalk, researchers can assess the effects of specific policies or interventions on the targeted geographic areas.

4. Enabling spatial analysis and data integration: The CBSA and ZIP code information can be used to integrate this dataset with other spatial datasets, allowing for more comprehensive geospatial analysis and the discovery of new insights.

Assumptions and Limitations:
- The data is aggregated at the CBSA and ZIP code level, so it does not provide a more granular mapping (e.g., at the individual address level).
- The table contains multiple years of data, so users must filter the data based on the `mimi_src_file_date` or `mimi_src_file_name` to ensure they are using the desired year's crosswalk.
- The mapping between CBSAs and ZIP codes may be many-to-many, so for a one-to-many mapping, users should refer to the `cbsa_to_zip_otm` table.
- The data is a snapshot of the crosswalk at the time of the annual update, and it may not reflect any changes or updates that occur between the annual releases.

Possible Extensions:
- Analyzing trends in address ratios over time to understand changes in population and business dynamics.
- Combining the CBSA-ZIP data with other datasets, such as economic indicators or health outcomes, to investigate spatial correlations and patterns.
- Developing more sophisticated geospatial models or analyses using the CBSA and ZIP code information as a foundation.
- Exploring the use of the CBSA-ZIP crosswalk for targeted marketing, site selection, or logistics planning.

    - Additional Notes: This query demonstrates the core business value of the mimi_ws_1.huduser.cbsa_to_zip table, which provides a crosswalk between Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) and USPS ZIP codes. It can be used for analyzing the distribution of addresses, studying the relationship between CBSA-ZIP characteristics and socioeconomic indicators, evaluating the impact of local policies, and enabling spatial analysis and data integration. However, the data is aggregated at the CBSA and ZIP code level, and the table contains multiple years of data, so users must filter the data to ensure they are using the desired year's crosswalk.
