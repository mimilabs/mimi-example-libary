-- Analyze ZIP Code to CBSA Mapping

/*
Business Purpose:
The `zip_to_cbsa` table provides a valuable mapping between USPS ZIP codes and Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs).
This information can be used to gain insights into the demographic, economic, and geographic characteristics of different regions,
which is crucial for a wide range of business applications, such as market research, site selection, and customer segmentation.

The key business value of this table includes:

1. Enabling geographic analysis and spatial modeling by linking granular ZIP code data to larger metropolitan or micropolitan areas.
2. Facilitating the study of regional trends and patterns, such as population distribution, economic performance, and housing market dynamics.
3. Supporting more accurate location-based decision-making and targeting of products or services.
4. Providing a foundation for developing predictive models that leverage the relationship between ZIP codes and their associated CBSAs.

-- Query to demonstrate the core business value of the `zip_to_cbsa` table

-- Filter the data to the most recent year
WITH latest_data AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM mimi_ws_1.huduser.zip_to_cbsa
  WHERE mimi_src_file_date = (SELECT MAX(mimi_src_file_date) FROM mimi_ws_1.huduser.zip_to_cbsa)
)

-- Analyze the distribution of population across CBSAs
SELECT
  cbsa,
  SUM(res_ratio) AS total_population_ratio
FROM latest_data
GROUP BY cbsa
ORDER BY total_population_ratio DESC
LIMIT 10;

/*
This query identifies the top 10 CBSAs by their total residential population ratio, which provides insights into the distribution of population
across different metropolitan and micropolitan areas. This information can be valuable for market analysis, site selection, and understanding
regional economic trends.

The query uses a CTE (common table expression) to filter the data to the most recent year, which is important to ensure the analysis reflects
the current geographic and demographic landscape.

Assumptions and Limitations:
- The `res_ratio` column is used as a proxy for population, assuming it is a reliable indicator of the relative size of residential areas within each ZIP-CBSA pair.
- The data only provides a snapshot in time and does not capture changes or updates that may occur within the year.
- The many-to-many mapping between ZIP codes and CBSAs may require additional processing or analysis to address specific business needs.

Possible Extensions:
- Analyze the changes in population distribution over time by comparing the top CBSAs across multiple years.
- Investigate the relationship between the demographic or socioeconomic characteristics of ZIP codes and the economic performance of their associated CBSAs.
- Develop models to predict consumer behavior or market demand at a local level using the ZIP-to-CBSA crosswalk.
- Explore regional patterns or disparities in the distribution of ZIP codes across CBSAs and identify potential underlying factors.
