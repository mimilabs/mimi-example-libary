Title: ZIP to County Primary Mapping Analysis
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes the core mapping between ZIP codes and their primary counties
based on residential address distribution. It helps understand:
- Geographic coverage of ZIP codes across counties
- Strength of ZIP-county relationships through residential ratios  
- State-level distribution of ZIP codes
*******************************************************************************/

-- Main analysis of ZIP to county mappings with key metrics
SELECT 
    -- State-level grouping
    usps_zip_pref_state as state,
    
    -- Count distinct ZIP codes and counties
    COUNT(DISTINCT zip) as num_zip_codes,
    COUNT(DISTINCT county) as num_counties,
    
    -- Analyze residential ratio distribution 
    ROUND(AVG(res_ratio), 3) as avg_res_ratio,
    ROUND(MIN(res_ratio), 3) as min_res_ratio,
    ROUND(MAX(res_ratio), 3) as max_res_ratio,
    
    -- Get counts of strong vs weak mappings
    SUM(CASE WHEN res_ratio >= 0.8 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as strong_mappings,
    SUM(CASE WHEN res_ratio < 0.5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as weak_mappings

FROM mimi_ws_1.huduser.zip_to_county_mto

-- Focus on mappings with meaningful residential presence
WHERE res_ratio > 0

GROUP BY usps_zip_pref_state
ORDER BY num_zip_codes DESC;

/*******************************************************************************
How this query works:
1. Groups ZIP-county mappings by state
2. Calculates key metrics around ZIP code coverage and mapping strength
3. Filters for mappings with some residential presence
4. Orders results by state size in terms of ZIP codes

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes res_ratio is the key indicator of ZIP-county relationship strength
- Limited to analyzing the primary county mapping only
- Does not account for temporal changes in mappings

Possible Extensions:
1. Add time-based analysis using mimi_src_file_date
2. Include business ratio analysis for commercial areas
3. Add geographic clustering analysis
4. Compare against demographic or economic data
5. Create tier classifications based on ratio thresholds

    - Additional Notes: Query aggregates at state level to show ZIP-to-county mapping coverage and quality. The res_ratio thresholds (0.8 for strong, 0.5 for weak) are configurable based on business needs. Consider adjusting these thresholds or adding additional metrics like business ratios depending on specific use cases.
