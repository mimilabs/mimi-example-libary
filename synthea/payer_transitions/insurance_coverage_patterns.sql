Title: Analysis of Insurance Coverage Patterns and Transitions
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes key patterns in health insurance coverage to:
- Identify average duration of coverage by insurance type
- Flag potential gaps in coverage
- Track transition patterns between different payers
- Support healthcare access and continuity of care initiatives
*******************************************************************************/

WITH coverage_metrics AS (
  -- Calculate coverage duration and identify transitions
  SELECT
    patient,
    payer,
    ownership,
    start_year,
    end_year,
    (end_year - start_year) as coverage_duration,
    LEAD(start_year) OVER (PARTITION BY patient ORDER BY start_year) as next_coverage_start
  FROM mimi_ws_1.synthea.payer_transitions
)

SELECT
  -- Aggregate metrics by insurance ownership type
  ownership,
  COUNT(DISTINCT patient) as total_patients,
  ROUND(AVG(coverage_duration),1) as avg_years_coverage,
  
  -- Calculate coverage gap metrics
  SUM(CASE 
    WHEN next_coverage_start > end_year THEN 1 
    ELSE 0 
  END) as coverage_gaps,
  
  -- Get distribution of coverage durations
  ROUND(PERCENTILE(coverage_duration, 0.5),1) as median_years_coverage,

GROUP BY ownership
ORDER BY total_patients DESC;

/*******************************************************************************
How this query works:
1. CTE creates base metrics including coverage duration and next coverage period
2. Main query aggregates key statistics by insurance ownership type
3. Identifies gaps between coverage periods
4. Provides distribution statistics on coverage duration

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes coverage periods are recorded chronologically
- Gap analysis only considers sequential coverage periods
- Does not account for partial year coverage
- Limited to ownership-level analysis vs specific payer analysis

Possible Extensions:
1. Add patient demographics analysis
2. Calculate transition rates between specific payers
3. Analyze seasonal patterns in coverage changes
4. Add geographic dimension to analysis
5. Track year-over-year trends in coverage patterns

    - Additional Notes: Query provides a high-level overview of insurance coverage metrics grouped by ownership type. Requires sufficient historical data in the payer_transitions table to calculate meaningful transition patterns and gap analysis. Performance may be impacted with very large patient populations due to window functions and aggregations.
