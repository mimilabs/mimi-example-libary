Title: Top 10 Most Costly Medications Analysis
 
Business Purpose:
- Identify the medications driving the highest total costs
- Analyze insurance coverage patterns for expensive medications
- Support strategic decisions around medication cost management
- Enable data-driven discussions with payers about coverage rates
*******************************************************************************/

WITH MedicationCosts AS (
    -- Calculate key metrics for each unique medication
    SELECT 
        description as medication_name,
        COUNT(DISTINCT patient) as patient_count,
        ROUND(AVG(payer_coverage/totalcost)*100, 2) as avg_coverage_pct,

    WHERE totalcost > 0 -- Exclude zero cost records
    AND stop IS NOT NULL -- Only include completed medication courses
    GROUP BY description

    total_cost,

/*******************************************************************************
How This Query Works:
1. Creates a CTE to aggregate medication costs and coverage metrics
2. Filters for valid cost data and completed medication courses
3. Calculates key business metrics including coverage rates and per-patient costs
4. Returns the top 10 most costly medications ranked by total cost

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes totalcost and payer_coverage are reliable measures
- Only considers completed medication courses (where stop date exists)
- Does not account for partial year effects or seasonal variations
- Coverage percentage calculation assumes no data quality issues

Possible Extensions:
1. Add time-based trending analysis:
   - Year-over-year cost changes
   - Seasonal patterns in prescribing
   
2. Enhance cost analysis:
   - Break down by payer type
   - Compare actual vs base costs
   - Analyze dispense patterns
   
3. Add patient demographics:
   - Age group analysis
   - Geographic distribution
   - Correlation with specific conditions

4. Risk analysis:
   - High-cost patient identification
   - Coverage gap analysis
   - Cost outlier detection

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on completed medication courses with non-zero costs. Results show both total impact (aggregate costs) and per-patient metrics. Coverage percentage calculations assume valid payer data. Consider running for specific date ranges if analyzing trends over time.
