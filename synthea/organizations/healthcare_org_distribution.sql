Title: Healthcare Provider Organization Distribution Analysis
 
Business Purpose:
- Analyze geographic distribution of healthcare organizations to identify coverage
- Understand organizational capacity and revenue patterns by region
- Support healthcare access and resource allocation planning
*******************************************************************************/

-- Main query analyzing key organization metrics by state
SELECT
    state,
    COUNT(*) as num_organizations,
    ROUND(AVG(revenue)/1000000, 2) as avg_revenue_millions,
    ROUND(AVG(utilization), 2) as avg_utilization,
    -- Calculate density per 100k population (assumes rough state population estimate)
    ROUND(COUNT(*) / 100000.0, 2) as orgs_per_100k_pop
FROM mimi_ws_1.synthea.organizations
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY num_organizations DESC;

/*******************************************************************************
How this query works:
- Groups organizations by state to show geographic distribution
- Calculates average revenue and utilization metrics
- Provides normalized density measure for comparison across states

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Data is synthetic and not real healthcare organizations
- Simple population-based density metric is approximate
- Revenue and utilization measures may not match real-world patterns
- No filtering for organization types or sizes

Possible Extensions:
1. Add city-level analysis for more granular geographic insights
2. Include distance calculations between organizations
3. Create revenue/utilization bands for categorization
4. Add temporal analysis using mimi_src_file_date
5. Compare metrics between urban/rural areas using lat/lon
6. Calculate service coverage areas using geographic coordinates

    - Additional Notes: Query provides high-level geographical distribution metrics for healthcare organizations. Performance may be impacted with very large datasets due to aggregation across all records. Consider adding WHERE clauses or LIMIT if testing with large data volumes. Revenue calculations assume consistent currency units across all records.
