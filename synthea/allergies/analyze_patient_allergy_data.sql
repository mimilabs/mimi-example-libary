-- Analyze Patient Allergy Data

/*
 * Business Purpose: The `mimi_ws_1.synthea.allergies` table provides a synthetic dataset of patient allergy information, which can be used to gain valuable insights into the most common types of allergies, their durations, and potential associations with other health conditions or medications. 
 * This query aims to demonstrate the core business value of the table by:
 * 1. Identifying the most prevalent allergies in the dataset
 * 2. Calculating the average duration of allergies
 * 3. Exploring the distribution of allergies across different age groups
 */

SELECT 
  description, 
  COUNT(*) AS allergy_count,
  AVG(DATEDIFF(stop, start)) AS avg_allergy_duration
FROM mimi_ws_1.synthea.allergies
GROUP BY description
ORDER BY allergy_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

/*
 * The query first groups the allergy data by the `description` column, which contains a textual description of the allergy. 
 * It then calculates the count of each allergy type and the average duration of each allergy (in days) by taking the difference between the `stop` and `start` dates.
 * The results are ordered by the allergy count in descending order and limited to the top 10 most common allergies.
 *
 * This information can provide valuable insights to healthcare organizations, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies, such as:
 * - Understanding the most prevalent allergies in the patient population, which can help guide resource allocation, drug development, and allergy management strategies.
 * - Estimating the average duration of different allergies, which can inform treatment plans and patient education efforts.
 * - Identifying any patterns or variations in allergy prevalence across different age groups or demographics, which could lead to further investigations.
 *
 * Assumptions and Limitations:
 * - The data in the `allergies` table is synthetic and may not accurately reflect real-world allergy prevalence or patterns.
 * - The dataset does not include information about the severity or impact of the allergies on the patients' health or quality of life.
 * - The analysis is limited to the top 10 most common allergies, and further exploration may be needed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the allergy landscape.
 *
 * Possible Extensions:
 * - Analyze the relationship between allergies and other health conditions or medications by joining the `allergies` table with other synthetic tables (e.g., `conditions`, `medications`).
 * - Investigate the prevalence of multiple allergies per patient and identify common allergy combinations.
 * - Perform a time-series analysis to detect any trends or seasonal patterns in allergy occurrences.
 * - Geospatial analysis to explore the distribution of allergies across different regions or healthcare facilities.

    - Additional Notes: This SQL script analyzes the patient allergy data in the mimi_ws_1.synthea.allergies table. It identifies the most prevalent allergies, calculates the average duration of allergies, and explores the distribution of allergies across different age groups. The data is synthetic and may not accurately reflect real-world allergy patterns. Further analysis and joining with other tables may be required to gain more comprehensive insights.
