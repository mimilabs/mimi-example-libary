-- Analyze the Geographic Distribution of Healthcare Providers

-- This query demonstrates the business value of the `address_census_geocoder_raw` table by exploring the geographic distribution of healthcare providers.

-- The key steps are:
-- 1. Aggregate the geocoded provider addresses by state and county to understand the spatial patterns.
-- 2. Visualize the provider density using a geographic visualization tool.
-- 3. Combine the geocoded data with other datasets to analyze the accessibility and distribution of healthcare services.

SELECT
  state_fips,
  county_fips,
  COUNT(*) AS provider_count
FROM mimi_ws_1.nppes.address_census_geocoder_raw
WHERE match_indicator = 'Match'
GROUP BY state_fips, county_fips
ORDER BY provider_count DESC;

-- This query aggregates the geocoded provider addresses by state and county, counting the number of providers in each geographic area. 
-- The `match_indicator` filter ensures we only include addresses that were successfully geocoded.
-- The results can be used to understand the distribution of healthcare providers across the United States.

-- To extend this analysis, you could:
-- - Visualize the provider density on a map using a tool like Tableau or Power BI.
-- - Combine the geocoded data with population or demographic data to analyze provider accessibility.
-- - Identify areas with low provider density or high patient-to-provider ratios.
-- - Segment the providers by specialty or type to understand the distribution of different healthcare services.

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - The geocoding process may not have a 100% match rate, so the data may not represent all providers.
-- - The data is a snapshot in time and may not reflect the most current provider locations.
-- - The accuracy of the geocoding depends on the quality of the input addresses and the limitations of the Census Geocoder API.
-- - The analysis focuses on the geographic distribution, but does not consider other factors like provider capacity, patient volumes, or health outcomes.

    - Additional Notes: This query analyzes the geographic distribution of healthcare providers by aggregating their geocoded addresses by state and county. It can be used to identify areas with high or low provider density and as a foundation for further analysis combining the geocoded data with other datasets.
