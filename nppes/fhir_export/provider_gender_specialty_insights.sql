-- Exploring Healthcare Provider Insights from NPPES-FHIR Data

/*
  Business Purpose:
  This SQL query aims to extract valuable insights from the `mimi_ws_1.nppes.fhir_export` table,
  which contains healthcare provider information in the FHIR format. The query focuses on
  understanding the gender distribution of providers across different specialties, as well as
  identifying the most common provider names and their associated specialties.

  This information can be used to:
  - Analyze the diversity and representation within the healthcare workforce
  - Identify potential gaps or imbalances in provider specialties
  - Understand naming trends and patterns among healthcare providers
  - Support workforce planning and target recruitment efforts

SELECT
  extension_primarySpecialty,

  COUNT(*) AS provider_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mimi_ws_1.nppes.fhir_export), 2) AS percentage
FROM mimi_ws_1.nppes.fhir_export
WHERE active = TRUE
GROUP BY extension_primarySpecialty, gender
ORDER BY provider_count DESC;

/*
  Explanation of the Query:
  1. The query selects the `extension_primarySpecialty`, `gender`, and `COUNT(*)` of providers
     for each combination of specialty and gender.
  2. It also calculates the percentage of providers for each specialty-gender combination
     relative to the total number of active providers in the table.
  3. The results are ordered by the `provider_count` in descending order, to show the most
     common provider specialties and their gender distributions.
  4. The `WHERE active = TRUE` filter ensures that the query only considers active providers,
     excluding those who may have had their NPI deactivated.

  Assumptions and Limitations:
  - The data in the `fhir_export` table is a snapshot and may not reflect the most up-to-date
    information about healthcare providers.
  - The accuracy and completeness of the data depend on the self-reporting by providers, which
    may lead to inconsistencies or missing information.
  - The table may not include all healthcare providers, as some may not have registered with
    NPPES or may have incomplete records.
  - The query does not consider other potentially relevant factors, such as provider location,
    years of experience, or other qualifications.

  Possible Extensions:
  1. Analyze the distribution of provider names by gender and specialty to identify any
     naming patterns or trends.
  2. Investigate the geographic distribution of providers by state or region, and how this
     varies by specialty and gender.
  3. Explore changes in the number of providers over time, based on the `extension_providerEnumerationDate`
     and `extension_npiDeactivationDates` columns.
  4. Identify potential provider shortages or oversupply in specific specialties or regions
     by combining this data with population health or utilization metrics.
