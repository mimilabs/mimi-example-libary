/* Healthcare Provider Network Analysis
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes the distribution and availability of healthcare providers
across specialties and acceptance status to understand provider network adequacy
and identify potential gaps in care access.

Key metrics include:
- Number of providers by specialty
- Acceptance rates for new patients
- Distribution of provider types
*/

-- Get key provider network metrics aggregated by specialty
WITH provider_metrics AS (
  SELECT 
    specialty,
    COUNT(DISTINCT npi) as provider_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN accepting = 'Y' THEN npi END) as accepting_providers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT facility_name) as facility_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT provider_type) as provider_type_count,
    -- Calculate acceptance rate
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN accepting = 'Y' THEN npi END) / 
          NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT npi), 0), 1) as acceptance_rate
  FROM mimi_ws_1.datahealthcaregov.provider_base
  WHERE specialty IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY specialty
)

SELECT
  specialty,
  provider_count,
  accepting_providers,
  facility_count,
  provider_type_count,
  acceptance_rate
FROM provider_metrics
WHERE provider_count >= 10 -- Filter for meaningful sample sizes
ORDER BY provider_count DESC
LIMIT 20;

/* How This Query Works:
1. Creates a CTE to calculate key metrics by specialty
2. Aggregates distinct providers, facilities, and provider types
3. Calculates acceptance rate as percentage
4. Filters for specialties with meaningful sample sizes
5. Returns top 20 specialties by provider count

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes specialty field is standardized and meaningful
- Limited to top 20 specialties by volume
- Does not account for geographic distribution
- Acceptance status may not be consistently reported

Possible Extensions:
1. Add geographic analysis by joining with location data
2. Trend analysis by incorporating historical data
3. Provider density calculations using population data
4. Network adequacy scoring by comparing to benchmarks
5. Language availability analysis by specialty

    - Additional Notes: Query assumes data completeness in specialty and accepting fields. For more accurate network adequacy assessment, consider joining with geographic and population data tables. Performance may be impacted with very large datasets due to multiple DISTINCT counts.
