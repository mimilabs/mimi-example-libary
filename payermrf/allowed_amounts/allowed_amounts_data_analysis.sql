-- Allowed Amounts Data Analysis

/*
 * This query demonstrates the core business value of the `mimi_ws_1.payermrf.allowed_amounts` table.
 * 
 * The allowed amounts data provides insights into out-of-network pricing practices across different
 * healthcare payers and providers. This information can be leveraged to:
 * 
 * 1. Understand the variability in out-of-network pricing for specific medical procedures or services.
 * 2. Identify potential cost-saving opportunities for patients seeking out-of-network care.
 * 3. Analyze the relationship between billed charges and allowed amounts for out-of-network services.
 * 4. Detect any significant differences in out-of-network pricing based on provider characteristics (e.g., TIN type).

/*
 * This query aggregates the `allowed_amounts` data by the `tin_type` column, which indicates whether the
 * provider's Tax Identifier Number (TIN) is an Employer Identification Number (EIN) or the provider's National
 * Provider Identifier (NPI).
 *
 * The key metrics calculated are:
 * 1. Average billed charge: The average total dollar amount charged by out-of-network providers.
 * 2. Average allowed amount: The average dollar amount paid by the payer for out-of-network services.
 * 3. Billed-to-allowed ratio: The ratio of the average billed charge to the average allowed amount, which
 *    provides insight into the potential differences in out-of-network pricing practices between providers
 *    with different TIN types.
 *
 * Assumptions and Limitations:
 * - The data represents a snapshot in time and may not reflect the most current pricing information.
 * - The dataset only includes data from UnitedHealthcare and Medica, which may not be representative of the
 *   entire healthcare industry.
 * - The provider identities are anonymized, limiting the ability to analyze pricing data at the individual
 *   provider level.
 *
 * Possible Extensions:
 * - Analyze the allowed amounts data by other dimensions, such as service code, billing code, or geographical
 *   location, to identify more specific trends and insights.
 * - Compare the out-of-network pricing data to in-network pricing data to understand the overall cost differences
 *   between in-network and out-of-network care.
 * - Develop predictive models to estimate the potential savings for patients seeking out-of-network care based
 *   on the historical pricing data.
