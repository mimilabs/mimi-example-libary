-- Analyze Healthcare Provider Network Composition and Pricing

-- This query provides insights into the composition and structure of healthcare provider networks
-- by analyzing the provider_references table in the mimi_ws_1.payermrf schema.

-- The key business value of this analysis includes:
-- 1. Understanding the number and types of healthcare providers included in payer networks
-- 2. Identifying patterns and trends in provider identifiers (TINs, NPIs) that can inform network management
-- 3. Enabling deeper analysis of provider pricing and network data by linking the provider_references
--    table with other tables in the payermrf schema, such as in-network rates and provider groups.

SELECT
  tin_type,
  COUNT(DISTINCT provider_group_id) AS unique_providers,
  COUNT(DISTINCT tin_value) AS unique_tins
FROM mimi_ws_1.payermrf.provider_references
GROUP BY tin_type
ORDER BY unique_providers DESC;

-- This query provides an overview of the healthcare providers included in the provider_references table,
-- including the number of unique provider groups and the distribution of provider identifiers (TINs and NPIs).

-- The key insights from this analysis include:
-- 1. Understanding the relative proportions of providers identified by EINs (tin_type = 'ein') vs. NPIs (tin_type = 'npi')
-- 2. Identifying the number of unique provider groups and TINs, which can inform network composition and management
-- 3. Providing a foundation for further analysis, such as linking provider data with pricing and network information

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - The provider_references table represents a snapshot of provider data at a specific point in time,
--   so the results may not reflect the most up-to-date information.
-- - The data in the table is anonymized and does not contain personally identifiable information about individual providers,
--   which may limit the ability to link this data with external datasets.
-- - The completeness and accuracy of the data in the provider_references table may vary depending on the data
--   reporting and validation processes used by the payers submitting the data.

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Analyze the distribution of provider types (e.g., hospital, physician, specialist) within the provider_references table
-- 2. Investigate the geographic distribution of providers by linking the provider_references table with
--    location-based data (e.g., state, county, ZIP code)
-- 3. Evaluate the performance and characteristics of healthcare providers included in payer networks by
--    combining the provider_references table with external datasets (e.g., quality metrics, patient satisfaction data)
