-- Nursing Home Quality Insights

/*
This query provides insights into the quality of nursing homes across the United States using the Nursing Home Minimum Data Set (MDS) Files.

The key business value of this data includes:
1. Identifying geographic trends in nursing home quality and accessibility
2. Analyzing the relationship between nursing home characteristics (e.g., ownership, size) and quality of care
3. Tracking changes in the nursing home industry over time
4. Informing policy decisions and resource allocation to improve long-term care

By leveraging this data, stakeholders such as policymakers, healthcare providers, and the general public can make more informed decisions and drive improvements in the quality of nursing home care.

/*
This query first creates a CTE (Common Table Expression) called `nursing_homes` that extracts the key columns from the `mimi_ws_1.provdatacatalog.nursinghomes_mds` table. This simplifies the main query and makes it more focused on the business value.

The main query then aggregates the data at the state level to provide the following insights:

1. The number of nursing homes in each state
2. The average quality score (four-quarter average) for nursing homes in each state
3. The number of nursing homes in each state that are rated under the Five-Star Quality Rating System

These insights can help identify geographic trends in nursing home quality and accessibility, which can inform resource allocation and policy decisions to improve long-term care.

Assumptions and Limitations:
- The data represents a snapshot in time and may not reflect the most current information. Periodic updates to the dataset are necessary to track changes over time.
- The data only includes nursing homes certified by CMS, so it may not represent the full universe of nursing homes in the United States.
- The quality measures used in the Five-Star Quality Rating System may not capture all aspects of nursing home quality, and there may be other important factors to consider.

Possible Extensions:
- Analyze the relationship between nursing home characteristics (e.g., ownership type, size) and quality of care
- Investigate the factors contributing to differences in quality scores between states or regions
- Identify disparities in nursing home accessibility and quality between urban and rural areas
- Incorporate additional data sources (e.g., population demographics, healthcare infrastructure) to provide a more comprehensive analysis

    - Additional Notes: This query provides valuable insights into the quality and accessibility of nursing homes across the United States. The key limitations are that the data only represents a snapshot in time and may not capture the full universe of nursing homes. Additionally, the quality measures used may not reflect all aspects of nursing home care. Possible extensions include analyzing the relationship between nursing home characteristics and quality, as well as identifying disparities in nursing home accessibility and quality between urban and rural areas.
