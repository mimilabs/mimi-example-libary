Title: Virtual Group MIPS Performance Analysis
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes the performance of virtual groups in the Merit-Based Incentive
Payment System (MIPS) by calculating key performance metrics across different
measure types. This helps identify how well virtual groups are performing on
quality measures and compliance requirements.

/*******************************************************************************
How this query works:
1. Creates a CTE to aggregate performance statistics by measure
2. Calculates average performance rates and total patient counts
3. Categorizes performance levels into meaningful buckets
4. Returns top 20 measures by performance rate

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes null performance rates should be treated as 0
- Focuses only on measures with actual performance rates and patient counts
- Limited to top 20 measures for readability
- Does not account for inverse measures separately

Possible Extensions:
1. Add time-based trending by incorporating mimi_src_file_date
2. Break down performance by attestation vs measured performance
3. Compare performance across different collection types
4. Add geographical analysis if location data is available
5. Analyze correlation between group size and performance
6. Include confidence intervals based on patient counts

    - Additional Notes: The query provides a high-level performance snapshot of virtual groups across MIPS measures, focusing on average performance rates and patient volumes. Note that the performance categorization thresholds (Excellent: >=90, Good: >=70, Fair: >=50) are arbitrary and may need adjustment based on specific program requirements or benchmarks. The query currently excludes the handling of inverse measures where lower scores indicate better performance.
