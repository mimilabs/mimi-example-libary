/*
Business Purpose: 
Analyze how virtual groups utilize different collection types (submission methods) for MIPS reporting
to understand preferred data submission approaches and their relationship to performance.
This helps:
- Vendors optimize their data collection solutions
- Healthcare organizations make informed decisions about reporting methods
- CMS evaluate the effectiveness of different submission pathways

/*
How it works:
1. First CTE aggregates key metrics by collection type
2. Second CTE adds ranking dimensions
3. Final query formats and presents the results in a business-friendly way

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Assumes collection_type values are standardized and clean
- Null performance rates and patient counts are excluded from averages
- Does not account for temporal changes in collection methods
- Does not consider measure complexity differences between collection types

Possible Extensions:
1. Add trend analysis by including mimi_src_file_date
2. Break down by measure types (Quality vs PI vs IA)
3. Add geographical analysis if location data becomes available
4. Include correlation analysis between collection type and measure performance
5. Add measure complexity scoring to weight the analysis

Note that ATT=Web Attestation, CLM=Claims, EHR=Electronic Health Record, REG=Qualified Registry, WI=CMS Web Interface. Performance metrics may vary significantly based on the collection method due to different data capture capabilities and measure specifications.
