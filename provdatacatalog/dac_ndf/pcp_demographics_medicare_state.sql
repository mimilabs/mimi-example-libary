-- Title: Primary Care Provider Demographics and Medicare Participation Analysis

-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyzes the demographic characteristics and Medicare participation patterns of primary care physicians
-- to help healthcare organizations and policymakers:
-- 1. Understand the age distribution of PCPs based on graduation years
-- 2. Assess gender diversity in primary care
-- 3. Track Medicare assignment acceptance rates
-- 4. Identify potential succession planning needs in different regions

-- Query Operation:
-- 1. Creates a CTE focusing on primary care providers from the most recent data
-- 2. Calculates key demographic and practice metrics by state
-- 3. Includes only states with sufficient sample size for statistical relevance

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- 1. Assumes graduation year is a reasonable proxy for provider age/experience
-- 2. Limited to providers who have reported graduation years
-- 3. Does not account for part-time vs full-time status
-- 4. May include some providers who are no longer actively practicing

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add trending analysis by comparing multiple mimi_src_file_dates
-- 2. Include analysis of secondary specialties
-- 3. Add geographic clustering analysis using ZIP codes
-- 4. Incorporate facility size (num_org_mem) into the analysis
-- 5. Compare urban vs rural distributions using ZIP code demographics

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on licensed primary care physicians (Internal Medicine, Family Practice, General Practice) and their Medicare participation patterns by state. Requires recent data in the source table and meaningful state-level sample sizes (nâ‰¥20) for accurate analysis.
