Title: MIPS Provider Performance Analysis - Core Metrics
 
Business Purpose:
- Analyze clinician performance in the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS)
- Identify high performing providers and performance patterns
- Support quality improvement initiatives and value-based care goals
*******************************************************************************/

-- Main analysis query showing key performance metrics by provider
SELECT 
    -- Provider identification
    provider_last_name,
    provider_first_name,
    npi,
    
    -- Performance metrics
    COUNT(DISTINCT measure_cd) as total_measures_reported,
    
    -- Calculate average performance across all measures
    AVG(CASE WHEN prf_rate IS NOT NULL THEN prf_rate ELSE NULL END) as avg_performance_rate,
    
    -- Get average star rating 
    AVG(CASE WHEN star_value IS NOT NULL THEN star_value ELSE NULL END) as avg_star_rating,
    
    -- Patient volume
    SUM(COALESCE(patient_count, 0)) as total_patients,
    
    -- APM participation
    MAX(CASE WHEN apm_affl_1 IS NOT NULL THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N' END) as participates_in_apm

FROM mimi_ws_1.provdatacatalog.dac_ec_public_reporting

-- Focus on most recent data
WHERE mimi_src_file_date = (
    SELECT MAX(mimi_src_file_date) 
    FROM mimi_ws_1.provdatacatalog.dac_ec_public_reporting
)

GROUP BY 
    provider_last_name,
    provider_first_name, 
    npi

-- Show providers with significant measure reporting
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT measure_cd) >= 5

-- Order by performance
ORDER BY avg_star_rating DESC, avg_performance_rate DESC

LIMIT 1000;

/*******************************************************************************
How the Query Works:
1. Identifies providers using NPI and name
2. Calculates key performance metrics:
   - Number of measures reported
   - Average performance rate across measures  
   - Average star rating
   - Total patient volume
   - APM participation status
3. Filters for most recent data
4. Shows providers reporting 5+ measures
5. Orders by performance metrics

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Uses most recent data snapshot only
- Assumes measures are weighted equally in averages
- Limited to providers with 5+ measures for meaningful comparison
- Does not account for measure complexity/difficulty
- Performance rates may need context by measure type

Possible Extensions:
1. Add geographic analysis by joining provider location data
2. Break down performance by measure type/category
3. Trend analysis over multiple time periods
4. Peer group comparisons by specialty
5. Risk adjustment based on patient characteristics
6. Detailed APM participation analysis

    - Additional Notes: Query calculates key MIPS performance metrics at provider level from the most recent data snapshot. Performance averages (rates and star ratings) may be affected by NULL values and measure mix. The 5-measure minimum threshold helps ensure meaningful comparisons but may exclude some providers. Consider patient volume when interpreting results as small denominators can skew performance rates.
