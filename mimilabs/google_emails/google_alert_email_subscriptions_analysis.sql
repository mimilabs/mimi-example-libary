/*
This query retrieves the key columns from the `google_emails` table, including the subject line, date, sender information, email content, and metadata. It orders the results by the `date` column in descending order and limits the output to the latest 1,000 rows.

The business value of this data can be explored through the following steps:

1. **Analyze Email Subject Lines**: Examine the most common keywords and topics in the `subject` column to understand the types of information users are interested in receiving through Google Alerts.

2. **Identify Temporal Patterns**: Analyze the `date` column to identify any patterns or trends in the frequency of Google Alert emails over time. This can provide insights into user engagement and evolving information needs.

3. **Explore Sender Information**: Investigate any relationships between the `sender_name`, `sender_email`, and the content of the emails. This can help identify potential opportunities for targeted content or product recommendations.

4. **Perform Text Analysis**: Leverage text analysis techniques, such as topic modeling or sentiment analysis, on the `content` column to uncover deeper insights into the types of information users are interested in and their sentiment towards the alert content.

5. **Analyze Metadata**: Utilize the metadata columns (`mimi_src_file_date`, `mimi_src_file_name`, `mimi_dlt_load_date`) to understand the data provenance and the specific time period covered by the snapshot.

/*
Assumptions and Limitations:
- The data represents a snapshot of Google Alert email subscriptions and may not reflect the most current information.
- The sender names and email addresses may or may not be anonymized, which can raise privacy concerns if they represent real individuals.
- The specific time period covered by the data is not provided, so the analysis will be limited to the available date range.

Possible Extensions:
- Expand the analysis to include a larger date range or more recent data (if available) to capture broader trends.
- Investigate the relationship between the email subject, content, and user engagement (e.g., open rates, click-through rates).
- Explore the potential to use this data for predictive modeling or recommendation systems.
- Analyze the distribution and characteristics of the email content length or complexity across different types of alerts.
- Identify the most popular sources or websites included in the Google Alert emails.
