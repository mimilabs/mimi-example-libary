Title: County Population Center Analysis - Basic Distribution 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes the geographic distribution of population centers across US 
counties to help understand population concentration patterns. This information
is valuable for:
- Resource allocation and facility placement
- Service delivery optimization  
- Demographic analysis and planning
- Understanding population density patterns

-- Main query to get population distribution statistics by state
WITH state_stats AS (
  SELECT 
    stname,
    COUNT(DISTINCT countyfp) as county_count,
    SUM(population) as total_population,
    ROUND(AVG(latitude), 4) as avg_latitude,
    ROUND(AVG(longitude), 4) as avg_longitude,
    ROUND(AVG(population), 0) as avg_county_population
  FROM mimi_ws_1.census.centerofpop_co
  GROUP BY stname
)

SELECT
  stname as state_name,
  county_count,
  total_population,
  avg_county_population,
  -- Geographic center coordinates
  avg_latitude,
  avg_longitude
FROM state_stats
ORDER BY total_population DESC
LIMIT 20;

/*******************************************************************************
How This Query Works:
1. Creates a CTE to calculate key statistics for each state
2. Aggregates county-level data to state level
3. Presents results ordered by total population

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Uses 2020 Census data only - no historical trends
- Simple averaging of coordinates may not reflect true population center
- Does not account for geographic size differences between counties
- Limited to top 20 states by default

Possible Extensions:
1. Add population density calculations using geographic area
2. Compare against historical census data to show population shifts
3. Calculate distance from population centers to major cities
4. Add regional groupings for broader geographic analysis
5. Include demographic breakdowns if available in related tables

    - Additional Notes: This query summarizes county population centers at the state level and presents high-level population distribution metrics. The results are ordered by total population and limited to 20 states. Consider removing the LIMIT clause for complete national analysis, or adjusting geographic groupings based on specific regional analysis needs.
