Title: Population Distribution Analysis by Census Block Groups
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes population distribution patterns at the census block group level
by identifying the most populous block groups and their geographic locations.
This information is valuable for:
- Urban planning and development
- Public service allocation
- Demographics research
- Business location strategy

-- Main Query
WITH ranked_block_groups AS (
  -- Rank block groups by population within each state
  SELECT 
    statefp,
    countyfp,
    tractce,
    blkgrpce,
    population,
    latitude,
    longitude,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY statefp ORDER BY population DESC) as pop_rank
  FROM mimi_ws_1.census.centerofpop_bg
)
SELECT
  -- Format location identifiers
  statefp as state_fips,
  countyfp as county_fips,
  tractce as tract_code,
  blkgrpce as block_group,
  
  -- Core metrics
  population,
  ROUND(latitude, 4) as lat,
  ROUND(longitude, 4) as long,
  pop_rank as population_rank_in_state
FROM ranked_block_groups
WHERE pop_rank <= 10  -- Show top 10 most populous block groups per state
ORDER BY statefp, pop_rank;

/*******************************************************************************
How It Works:
1. Creates a CTE that ranks block groups by population within each state
2. Selects and formats key identifying fields and metrics
3. Filters to show only the top 10 most populous block groups per state
4. Orders results by state and population rank

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Uses 2020 Census data only - not historical trends
- Population centers may not reflect current demographics due to population shifts
- Geographic coordinates are approximations of population centers
- Some block groups may have unusual boundaries affecting center calculations

Possible Extensions:
1. Add state name lookup for better readability
2. Calculate population density using geographic area data
3. Compare urban vs rural population distributions
4. Add demographic overlays from other Census tables
5. Incorporate distance calculations to key facilities or services
6. Track changes over time using historical data

    - Additional Notes: This query focuses on population distribution analysis at the census block group level, identifying population hotspots within each state. For comprehensive geographic analysis, consider joining with additional Census Bureau reference tables for state/county names and demographic attributes.
