Title: Population Distribution Analysis by ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)

Business Purpose:
- Analyze population distribution patterns across ZIP Code areas in the US
- Identify high and low population density areas for business planning
- Provide foundational population metrics for resource allocation decisions

Created: 2024
*******************************************************************************/

-- Get population distribution statistics by ZCTA
SELECT 
    -- Basic ZCTA identification
    zcta,
    tot_population_est as population,
    
    -- Calculate population density indicators
    CASE 
        WHEN tot_population_est >= 50000 THEN 'High Density'
        WHEN tot_population_est >= 10000 THEN 'Medium Density' 
        ELSE 'Low Density'
    END as population_density_category,
    
    -- Calculate percentile rank of each ZCTA by population
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY tot_population_est) as population_percentile

FROM mimi_ws_1.census.pop_est_zcta
WHERE year = 2020  -- Focus on most recent census data
  AND tot_population_est > 0  -- Exclude unpopulated areas
ORDER BY tot_population_est DESC;

/*******************************************************************************
How This Query Works:
1. Pulls base population data from the ZCTA table
2. Categorizes ZCTAs into density levels
3. Calculates relative population rankings
4. Filters for populated areas in 2020
5. Orders results by population size

Key Assumptions & Limitations:
- Uses 2020 census data only
- Assumes ZCTA boundaries are relevant for analysis
- Simple density categorization may not fit all use cases
- Does not account for geographic area of ZCTAs

Possible Extensions:
1. Add geographic grouping (state/county level aggregations)
2. Include year-over-year population changes
3. Add demographic breakdowns if available
4. Calculate true population density using geographic area
5. Join with business/economic data for market analysis

    - Additional Notes: Query provides population density categorization and percentile rankings for US ZIP Code Tabulation Areas based on 2020 census data. Consider adjusting density thresholds (currently set at 50,000 and 10,000) based on specific business needs. Results exclude ZCTAs with zero population.
