-- Explore the Centers of Population Across U.S. States

/*
Business Purpose:
The `mimi_ws_1.census.centerofpop_st` table provides the geographic coordinates of the center of population for each U.S. state. This information can be used to gain insights into the distribution of population within and across states, which can inform business decisions and strategies.

Some potential use cases for this data include:
- Visualizing the population distribution within a state on a map
- Analyzing the relationship between a state's population center and its geographic center or capital city
- Identifying patterns and trends in the location of population centers across different regions of the country
- Assessing how population shifts over time may impact the distribution of political power or the delivery of public services

/*
This query retrieves the key information from the `centerofpop_st` table, including the state name, latitude and longitude of the population center, and the 2020 Census population. The results are sorted by population in descending order to identify the states with the largest populations.

The business value of this data includes:
1. Visualizing population distribution: The latitude and longitude coordinates can be used to plot the location of each state's population center on a map, providing a visual representation of where people live within each state.
2. Spatial analysis: The population center data can be combined with other geographic information, such as state boundaries or transportation networks, to analyze the relationship between population distribution and other factors.
3. Identifying population trends: By comparing the population center data over time, businesses can identify shifts in where people are living within a state, which may have implications for the delivery of products, services, or infrastructure.
4. Informing strategic decision-making: Understanding the location of population centers can help businesses make more informed decisions about the placement of facilities, the targeting of marketing campaigns, or the prioritization of investments in different regions.

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - The data represents a single snapshot in time (2020 Census) and does not provide historical trends or future projections.
-- - The table only includes state-level population centers, not more granular data such as county or city centers.
-- - The data does not provide additional context about the factors that influence the location of population centers, such as economic, demographic, or geographic factors.

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Join the population center data with other geographic or demographic datasets to perform more advanced spatial analyses.
-- 2. Develop visualizations or dashboards to help stakeholders quickly identify and interpret patterns in the location of population centers.
-- 3. Analyze how the location of population centers has changed over time and explore the potential drivers of these shifts.
-- 4. Investigate the relationship between a state's population center and its geographic center or capital city, and the implications for policymaking and service delivery.
