-- Centering Population Maps using the Center of Population

/*
This query demonstrates the core business value of the `mimi_ws_1.census.centerofpop_us` table, which provides the geographic coordinates for the "center of population" in the United States.

The center of population is a useful reference point for creating population-centric maps and visualizations. By centering a map on this location, we can better represent the overall distribution of the US population and identify areas of high and low population density.

SELECT 
  latitude,
  longitude
FROM mimi_ws_1.census.centerofpop_us
LIMIT 1;

/*
The main steps of this query are:

1. Select the `latitude` and `longitude` columns from the `centerofpop_us` table.
2. Limit the output to 1 row, as the table contains a single record representing the center of population.

This query provides the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the center of population, which can be used as the focal point for a variety of population-based maps and visualizations. Some examples include:

- Choropleth maps showing population density by state or county
- Scatter plots of population distribution across the country
- Heat maps highlighting areas of high and low population concentration
- Interactive maps that allow users to pan and zoom around the population center
*/

-- How the query works:
-- The `mimi_ws_1.census.centerofpop_us` table contains a single row with the latitude and longitude coordinates of the center of population in the United States, based on the 2020 Census. 
-- By selecting these two columns and limiting the output to 1 row, we can easily retrieve the necessary information to center a map or other visualization on the population distribution.

-- Assumptions and limitations:
-- This query assumes that the `centerofpop_us` table contains accurate and up-to-date information on the center of population. The data is based on the 2020 Census, so it may not reflect changes in population distribution since then.
-- The table does not provide any additional context or demographic information about the population distribution, so this query alone may not be sufficient for more complex analyses.

-- Possible extensions:
-- 1. Combine the center of population coordinates with other geographic data (e.g., state boundaries, major cities) to create more comprehensive population-focused maps.
-- 2. Analyze how the center of population has shifted over time by querying historical versions of the `centerofpop_us` table.
-- 3. Explore relationships between the center of population and other socioeconomic or demographic indicators, such as income, age, or educational attainment.
-- 4. Develop interactive visualizations that allow users to explore the population distribution and center of population in more depth.

    - Additional Notes: This SQL script demonstrates how to use the geographic coordinates from the `mimi_ws_1.census.centerofpop_us` table to center population-focused maps and visualizations. It provides the latitude and longitude of the population center, which can be utilized as a reference point for various analytical purposes. However, the data is based on the 2020 Census and may not reflect recent changes in population distribution.
