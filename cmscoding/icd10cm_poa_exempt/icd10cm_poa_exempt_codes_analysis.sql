-- ICD-10-CM Present on Admission (POA) Exempt Codes Analysis

-- This query provides insights into the business value of the `mimi_ws_1.cmscoding.icd10cm_poa_exempt` table, which contains ICD-10-CM codes that are exempt from the Present on Admission (POA) reporting requirement.

-- The key business value of this table is to help healthcare providers and researchers understand which conditions do not require POA reporting, which can be important for:
-- 1. Improving the accuracy and completeness of POA reporting
-- 2. Analyzing the impact of certain conditions on patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization
-- 3. Identifying potential areas for improving POA reporting policies and guidelines

SELECT

FROM
  mimi_ws_1.cmscoding.icd10cm_poa_exempt
ORDER BY
  mimi_src_file_date DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- This query retrieves the 10 most recent records from the table, showing the ICD-10-CM codes, their descriptions, and the metadata about the source file and data load dates.

-- By analyzing the table, researchers can:
-- 1. Identify the most common categories or types of conditions that are exempt from POA reporting
-- 2. Understand how the list of POA exempt codes has evolved over time and the implications of these changes
-- 3. Detect patterns or trends in the descriptions of the POA exempt codes that can provide insights into the reasons behind their exemption
-- 4. Utilize the POA exempt codes in conjunction with other healthcare datasets to study the impact of certain conditions on patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization
-- 5. Identify potential areas for improving the accuracy and completeness of POA reporting in healthcare settings

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - The table does not contain any provider-specific information, such as provider names or addresses, as it focuses solely on the ICD-10-CM codes and their descriptions.
-- - The data in the table is not anonymized, synthesized, or aggregated, as it represents a standard set of ICD-10-CM codes exempt from POA reporting.
-- - The table may not include the complete history of POA exempt codes, as it is based on the specific source file mentioned in the `mimi_src_file_name` column.

-- Possible Extensions:
-- - Analyze the distribution of POA exempt codes by category or type to identify the most common areas of exemption.
-- - Investigate how the list of POA exempt codes has changed over time and the potential implications for healthcare providers and researchers.
-- - Explore the descriptions of the POA exempt codes to identify any patterns or trends that could provide insights into the reasons behind their exemption.
-- - Combine the POA exempt codes with other healthcare datasets (e.g., patient outcomes, resource utilization) to study the impact of certain conditions on various metrics.
-- - Develop algorithms or models to identify potential areas for improving the accuracy and completeness of POA reporting in healthcare settings.
