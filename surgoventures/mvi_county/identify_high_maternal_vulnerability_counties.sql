-- Identifying Counties with High Maternal Vulnerability

-- This query aims to identify the counties with the highest Maternal Vulnerability Index (MVI) scores,
-- which can help policymakers and public health professionals target interventions and resources
-- to improve maternal health outcomes in the most vulnerable communities.

SELECT
  county_name,
  mvi,
  -- Additional variables can be selected to provide more context on the factors contributing to maternal vulnerability
  other_variables
FROM mimi_ws_1.surgoventures.mvi_county
ORDER BY mvi DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- How the query works:
-- 1. The query selects the county_name, mvi, and other_variables columns from the mmi_ws_1.surgoventures.mvi_county table.
-- 2. The results are ordered in descending order by the mvi column, so that the counties with the highest MVI scores are listed first.
-- 3. The LIMIT 10 clause returns the top 10 counties with the highest MVI scores.

-- Assumptions and limitations:
-- - The query assumes that the mmi_ws_1.surgoventures.mvi_county table is accessible and contains the necessary data.
-- - The query only focuses on the counties with the highest MVI scores, but it does not provide insights into the factors driving maternal vulnerability.
-- - The query does not account for the potential variability in MVI scores within a county or the need for more granular data to identify local-level disparities.

-- Possible extensions:
-- 1. Analyze the relationship between MVI scores and maternal health outcomes (e.g., maternal mortality, preterm birth rates) to better understand the impact of maternal vulnerability.
-- 2. Investigate the specific socioeconomic and demographic factors that contribute to high MVI scores in the identified counties, such as poverty, education levels, and access to healthcare.
-- 3. Expand the query to include all counties or a larger sample size to get a more comprehensive understanding of maternal vulnerability across the United States.
-- 4. Incorporate spatial analysis techniques to visualize the geographic distribution of maternal vulnerability and identify regional patterns or clusters.
-- 5. Explore the potential impact of state-level policies and programs on maternal health outcomes in high-vulnerability counties.

    - Additional Notes: This SQL script identifies the top 10 counties with the highest Maternal Vulnerability Index (MVI) scores, which can help policymakers and public health professionals target interventions and resources to improve maternal health outcomes in the most vulnerable communities. The script assumes that the mmi_ws_1.surgoventures.mvi_county table is accessible and contains the necessary data. However, it does not provide insights into the specific factors driving maternal vulnerability, nor does it account for potential variability in MVI scores within a county or the need for more granular data to identify local-level disparities.
