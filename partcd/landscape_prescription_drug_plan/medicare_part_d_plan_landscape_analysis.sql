How the query works:
1. The CTE `plan_summary` selects the key columns from the `landscape_prescription_drug_plan` table, focusing on the plan characteristics that are most relevant for the analysis. It also converts the `additional_drug_coverage_offered_in_the_gap` column from `STRING` to `BOOLEAN`.
2. The main query aggregates the plan-level data to the state level, calculating the following metrics:
   - Total number of plans available in each state
   - Average monthly premium and annual deductible
   - Number of plans that offer additional drug coverage in the coverage gap
   - Average star rating of the plans
   - Latest date of the data source file
3. The results are ordered by the total number of plans available in each state, providing a high-level view of the plan landscape.

Assumptions and Limitations:
- The data represents a snapshot in time and may not reflect the current landscape, as Medicare Part D plans can change from year to year.
- The analysis is limited to the plan-level characteristics included in the dataset, and does not consider individual-level enrollment or utilization data.
- The star ratings and other plan attributes may not fully capture the nuances of plan quality and suitability for different Medicare beneficiaries.

Possible Extensions:
- Analyze trends in plan availability, premiums, and other characteristics over time to identify changes in the landscape.
- Explore the relationship between plan characteristics (e.g., premiums, deductibles, coverage) and the demographic or health status of the Medicare population in each state.
- Investigate the market share and geographic coverage of different insurance companies offering Medicare Part D plans.
- Conduct more detailed comparisons of plan types (e.g., standalone prescription drug plans vs. Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans) and their relative benefits and costs.
