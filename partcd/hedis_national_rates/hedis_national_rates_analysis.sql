HEDIS National Rates Analysis

This query provides a high-level analysis of the HEDIS National Rates table, which contains aggregated data on various healthcare quality measures across the United States. The key business value of this data is to enable healthcare organizations, policymakers, and researchers to:

1. Understand national trends and benchmarks for healthcare quality over time.
2. Identify areas of improvement or decline in specific HEDIS measures.
3. Inform decision-making and target interventions to improve healthcare outcomes.
4. Compare the performance of the US healthcare system to other countries.

/*
This query retrieves the key data points from the HEDIS National Rates table, including the year, measure code, indicator description, rate, number of reporting contracts, and total number of enrollees. It focuses on the most recent 3 years of data (2018 to 2020) to analyze recent trends.

The results can be used to:
1. Identify the HEDIS measures with the highest and lowest national average rates, indicating areas of strength and weakness in the healthcare system.
2. Observe how the national average rates for specific HEDIS measures have changed over time, highlighting areas of improvement or decline.
3. Understand the scale and reach of the HEDIS data, as represented by the number of reporting contracts and total enrollees.

Assumptions and limitations:
- The data is aggregated at the national level and does not provide granular insights at the state, regional, or individual provider level.
- The data only covers the HEDIS measures and does not include other healthcare quality metrics that may be relevant for a comprehensive analysis.
- The data is limited to the years 2018 to 2020 and may not reflect the most current or up-to-date information.

Possible extensions:
- Analyze the trends in national average rates for specific HEDIS measures over a longer time period to identify long-term patterns.
- Investigate the relationship between the number of reporting contracts/enrollees and the national average rates to understand the representativeness of the data.
- Compare the national average rates for HEDIS measures across different healthcare domains (e.g., preventive care, chronic disease management) to identify areas of relative strength or weakness.
- Explore the feasibility of benchmarking the US healthcare system's HEDIS performance against that of other countries with similar healthcare systems.
