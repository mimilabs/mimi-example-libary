Medicare Advantage Dental Benefits Overview Query

Business Purpose:
Analyze key aspects of dental coverage offered by Medicare Advantage plans
to understand benefit design and accessibility for beneficiaries.
This helps assess:
- Prevalence of preventive vs comprehensive dental coverage
- Cost sharing requirements
- Benefit limitations and authorization requirements 
*********************************************************************/

-- Main query to analyze dental benefit design across plans
SELECT 
    pbp_a_plan_type,
    COUNT(DISTINCT bid_id) as total_plans,
    
    -- Analyze preventive dental coverage
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN pbp_b16a_bendesc_yn = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100,1) as pct_with_preventive,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN pbp_b16b_bendesc_yn = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100,1) as pct_with_comprehensive,
    
    -- Analyze cost sharing approach 
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN pbp_b16b_coins_yn = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100,1) as pct_using_coinsurance,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN pbp_b16b_copay_yn = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100,1) as pct_using_copays,
    
    -- Analyze authorization requirements
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN pbp_b16b_auth_yn = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100,1) as pct_requiring_auth,
    
    -- Analyze benefit caps
    AVG(NULLIF(pbp_b16b_maxplan_amt,0)) as avg_annual_benefit_cap

GROUP BY pbp_a_plan_type

/*********************************************************************
How this query works:
- Groups dental benefits by plan type
- Calculates percentage of plans offering key benefit features
- Uses conditional aggregation to analyze benefit design patterns
- Filters out plan types with small sample sizes

Key assumptions and limitations:
- Assumes current year data
- Does not account for regional variations
- Does not analyze network adequacy
- Does not consider premiums or overall plan costs

Possible extensions:
1. Add geographic analysis by state/region
2. Compare benefit designs across years
3. Analyze correlation with plan star ratings
4. Add detailed cost sharing analysis
5. Include network size/accessibility metrics

    - Additional Notes: Query aggregates at plan type level only - for market-level analysis would need geographic segmentation. Maximum benefit amounts may need adjustment for inflation when comparing across years. Plans with multiple segments are counted separately.
