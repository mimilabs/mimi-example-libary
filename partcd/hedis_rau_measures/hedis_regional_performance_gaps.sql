-- HEDIS Geographic Performance Distribution Analysis
-- Purpose: Analyze geographic patterns in HEDIS measure performance to identify
-- regional variations and potential disparities in care quality across Medicare Advantage contracts.
-- Business Value:
-- - Identifies geographic areas with consistently high or low performance
-- - Supports strategic market expansion and intervention planning
-- - Helps target quality improvement resources to underperforming regions
-- - Enables benchmarking against regional peers

-- How it works:
-- 1. Calculates risk-adjusted performance ratio (observed/expected) for each contract
-- 2. Groups contracts by region (first 2 digits of contract number)
-- 3. Computes regional statistics including average performance and variation
-- 4. Categorizes regions based on relative performance
-- 5. Orders results to highlight best and worst performing regions by measure

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Uses contract number prefix as proxy for geographic region
-- - Requires at least 3 contracts per region for meaningful comparison
-- - Focuses on single year analysis (2022)
-- - Assumes performance ratio of 1.0 represents meeting expectations
-- - Does not account for socioeconomic factors beyond risk adjustment

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year regional performance trends
-- 2. Include member volume weighting in regional averages
-- 3. Correlate with regional demographic or social determinant data
-- 4. Add drill-down capability to identify top performing contracts in each region
-- 5. Include confidence intervals for performance metrics

    - Additional Notes: Query requires sufficient data density across regions (minimum 3 contracts per region) to produce meaningful results. Performance categorization thresholds (0.9 and 1.1) may need adjustment based on specific measure distributions and organizational goals. Regional coding assumes standard CMS contract number format where first two digits indicate geographic area.
