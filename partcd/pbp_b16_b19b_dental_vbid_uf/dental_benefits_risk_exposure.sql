/* How this query works:
1. Identifies plans with benefit maximums for both preventive and comprehensive
2. Captures maximum benefit amounts and periods for comprehensive coverage
3. Flags coverage of high-cost services like implants and orthodontics  
4. Assigns risk levels based on maximum amounts and covered services

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Risk levels are simplified indicators based on benefit design only
- Does not account for utilization or demographic risk factors
- Dollar thresholds for risk levels may need adjustment based on market
- Maximum amounts may not reflect actual plan exposure

Possible Extensions:
1. Add geographic analysis of benefit maximums and risk levels
2. Include cost sharing requirements in risk assessment
3. Trend analysis of benefit changes over time
4. Correlation with plan premiums and enrollment
5. Provider network analysis for cost management

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on financial risk exposure through maximum coverage limits and high-cost service offerings. Risk scoring thresholds ($1000/$2000) may need adjustment based on specific market conditions and plan demographics. Consider enhancing with utilization data for more accurate risk assessment.
