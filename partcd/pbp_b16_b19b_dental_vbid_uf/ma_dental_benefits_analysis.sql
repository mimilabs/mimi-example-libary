Title: Medicare Advantage Dental Benefits Coverage Analysis
 
Business Purpose:
- Analyze dental benefit coverage and cost-sharing across Medicare Advantage plans
- Identify patterns in preventive vs comprehensive dental offerings
- Support decision-making around dental benefit design and market positioning

/*******************************************************************************
How it works:
- Pulls key dental benefit attributes at the contract-plan level
- Uses CASE statements to create binary flags for coverage types
- Identifies cost sharing approaches through copay/coinsurance fields
- Filters to most recent version of benefits

Assumptions/Limitations:
- Assumes latest version represents current benefits
- Does not account for mid-year changes
- Does not analyze network adequacy
- Text matching on benefit descriptions may miss some variants

Possible Extensions:
1. Add geographic analysis by joining to contract service area data
2. Compare benefits across plan types (MA vs SNP)
3. Analyze trends over time using version history
4. Calculate market-level statistics on benefit prevalence
5. Join to enrollment data to see uptake of different benefit designs

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on plan-level dental benefit design and assumes the highest version number represents current benefits. Cost sharing logic only captures presence/absence of copays/coinsurance, not specific amounts. Benefit coverage flags rely on text pattern matching which may need adjustment based on actual data patterns.
