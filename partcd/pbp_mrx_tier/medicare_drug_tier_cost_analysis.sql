/*
How this query works:
1. Selects key plan and tier identification fields
2. Includes retail and mail order cost sharing amounts
3. Counts number of plans sharing same tier structure
4. Filters for standard benefit plans only
5. Orders results by plan and tier

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Focuses on standard benefit designs only (not enhanced)
- Shows point-in-time snapshot of benefits
- Does not account for mid-year changes
- Cost sharing shown is pre-coverage gap

Possible Extensions:
1. Add year-over-year tier structure comparisons
2. Include analysis of specialty drug tiers
3. Compare costs across therapeutic categories
4. Analyze regional variations in tier designs
5. Add preferred pharmacy network analysis
6. Include insulin-specific cost sharing
