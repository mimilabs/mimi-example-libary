/*
How This Query Works:
1. First CTE aggregates hearing benefits at the plan level
2. Main query summarizes coverage patterns by plan type
3. Calculates key metrics including coverage rates and average benefits

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Assumes latest data point represents current benefits
- Averages may mask significant variation in actual benefit designs
- Does not account for network restrictions or authorization requirements

Possible Extensions:
1. Add geographic analysis by joining to contract service area tables
2. Trend analysis by comparing multiple years
3. Detailed analysis of authorization and network requirements
4. Competition analysis in specific markets
5. Correlation with plan star ratings or enrollment
