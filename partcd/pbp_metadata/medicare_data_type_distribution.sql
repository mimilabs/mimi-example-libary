-- Medicare Advantage Benefits Metadata - Field Type Distribution Analysis
-- Business Purpose: This query analyzes the structure and data types of Medicare Advantage benefits
-- information to help:
-- 1. Understand the complexity of data storage requirements
-- 2. Guide ETL processes and data quality checks
-- 3. Support database design and optimization decisions
-- 4. Identify potential standardization opportunities

WITH field_type_summary AS (
  -- Aggregate counts by data type
  SELECT 
    type,
    COUNT(*) as field_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT file) as files_using_type,
    COUNT(DISTINCT service_category) as categories_using_type
  FROM mimi_ws_1.partcd.pbp_metadata
  WHERE type IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY type
),

type_metrics AS (
  -- Calculate percentages and rankings
  SELECT 
    type,
    field_count,
    files_using_type,
    categories_using_type,
    ROUND(field_count * 100.0 / SUM(field_count) OVER(), 2) as pct_of_total_fields
  FROM field_type_summary
)

SELECT 
  type as data_type,
  field_count as number_of_fields,
  files_using_type as number_of_files,
  categories_using_type as number_of_categories,
  pct_of_total_fields as percentage_of_total_fields,
  -- Create a simple visualization of the distribution
  REPEAT('■', CAST(pct_of_total_fields AS INT)) as distribution_viz
FROM type_metrics
ORDER BY field_count DESC;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. First CTE aggregates counts for each data type across files and categories
-- 2. Second CTE calculates percentages and metrics
-- 3. Final SELECT creates a formatted output with a simple visualization

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- 1. Assumes type field is meaningful and standardized
-- 2. Null types are excluded from analysis
-- 3. Visualization may not display correctly in all SQL clients

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add trend analysis by comparing type distributions across different mimi_src_file_dates
-- 2. Include average field lengths for each type
-- 3. Cross-reference with actual data volumes to identify optimization opportunities
-- 4. Group similar types (e.g., different varchar lengths) for higher-level analysis
-- 5. Add correlations between types and service categories

    - Additional Notes: The query provides essential database structure insights through type distribution analysis, which is particularly valuable for data architects and ETL developers working with Medicare Advantage benefits data. The visual distribution representation (■) may need adjustment based on the SQL client being used.
