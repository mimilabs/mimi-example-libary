-- Medicare Advantage Benefits Metadata - Field Naming Pattern Analysis
--
-- Business Purpose: This query analyzes the field naming patterns and descriptive elements 
-- in the Medicare Advantage benefits metadata to:
-- 1. Understand how fields are organized and labeled across different service files
-- 2. Identify common naming conventions and descriptive patterns
-- 3. Help analysts and researchers more effectively navigate and locate specific benefit information
-- 4. Support documentation and data dictionary development efforts

WITH field_patterns AS (
    -- Extract key patterns from field names and titles
    SELECT 
        file,
        name,
        field_title,
        service_category,
        -- Identify if field contains common benefit-related terms
        CASE 
            WHEN LOWER(name) LIKE '%copay%' THEN 'Cost-Share: Copay'
            WHEN LOWER(name) LIKE '%coins%' THEN 'Cost-Share: Coinsurance'
            WHEN LOWER(name) LIKE '%limit%' THEN 'Benefit Limit'
            WHEN LOWER(name) LIKE '%auth%' THEN 'Authorization'
            WHEN LOWER(name) LIKE '%ref%' THEN 'Referral'
            ELSE 'Other'
        END AS field_category,
        mimi_src_file_date
    FROM mimi_ws_1.partcd.pbp_metadata
    WHERE name IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT 
    file,
    service_category,
    field_category,
    COUNT(*) as field_count,
    -- Create a sample list of field names for each category
    COLLECT_LIST(name) as sample_fields,
    mimi_src_file_date
FROM field_patterns
GROUP BY file, service_category, field_category, mimi_src_file_date
ORDER BY file, service_category, field_category;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to categorize fields based on common naming patterns
-- 2. Groups results by file and service category to show distribution
-- 3. Provides sample field names for each category to illustrate patterns
-- 4. Maintains temporal context through mimi_src_file_date

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- 1. Assumes consistent naming conventions across files
-- 2. Limited to predefined categories in the CASE statement
-- 3. May not capture all specialized field types
-- 4. Focuses on field names rather than actual values

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add analysis of json_question patterns to understand data collection methods
-- 2. Include type analysis to correlate field types with naming patterns
-- 3. Compare patterns across different source file dates to track changes
-- 4. Add validation rules based on identified patterns
-- 5. Create a more detailed classification system for field categories

    - Additional Notes: The query uses COLLECT_LIST to aggregate field names, which may return fields in an arbitrary order. For large datasets, consider using array_sort(COLLECT_LIST(name)) if consistent ordering is needed. The categorization system focuses on common benefit-related terms and may need adjustment based on specific analysis needs.
