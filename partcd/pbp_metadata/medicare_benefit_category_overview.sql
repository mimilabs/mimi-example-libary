Title: Medicare Advantage Benefits Metadata Analysis - Service Categories Overview

Business Purpose:
This query analyzes the Medicare Advantage benefits metadata to understand:
1. What service categories are covered in the benefits data
2. The volume and types of data fields for each service category
3. The data structure and field composition across different files

This helps stakeholders:
- Quickly understand what benefits information is available
- Plan analyses across service categories
- Identify key data fields for benefit design research
*******************************************************************************/

-- Main query analyzing service category composition and field details
SELECT 
    -- Group by service category
    COALESCE(service_category, 'Uncategorized') as benefit_category,
    
    -- Count distinct fields
    COUNT(DISTINCT name) as number_of_fields,
    
    -- Get most common data types 
    COLLECT_SET(type) as data_types,
    
    -- List sample field titles
    COLLECT_SET(field_title) as example_fields,
    
    -- Count files containing this category
    COUNT(DISTINCT file) as number_of_source_files

FROM mimi_ws_1.partcd.pbp_metadata

-- Filter out system metadata fields
WHERE name NOT LIKE 'mimi_%'

GROUP BY service_category
ORDER BY number_of_fields DESC;

/*******************************************************************************
How This Query Works:
1. Groups metadata by service category to show coverage breadth
2. Counts unique fields per category to show data granularity
3. Collects unique data types to understand technical structure
4. Provides sample field titles for context
5. Shows file distribution to understand data organization

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Assumes service_category field accurately categorizes benefits
- Excludes system metadata fields (mimi_* prefix)
- Aggregated view may mask detailed field-level nuances
- Some fields may serve multiple categories but are counted once
- COLLECT_SET returns unordered array of unique values

Possible Extensions:
1. Add temporal analysis using mimi_src_file_date
2. Break down by specific data types for technical planning
3. Analyze json_question field to understand data collection context
4. Cross-reference with actual benefits data for coverage analysis
5. Add filters for specific service categories of interest

    - Additional Notes: The query uses COLLECT_SET which returns arrays of unique values rather than concatenated strings, so results will need array handling for downstream processing. Service categories with null values will be grouped under 'Uncategorized'. Results exclude system metadata fields (prefixed with 'mimi_').
