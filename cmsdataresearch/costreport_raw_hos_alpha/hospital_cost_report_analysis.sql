-- Hospital Cost Report Data Analysis

-- This query demonstrates the core business value of the `mimi_ws_1.cmsdataresearch.costreport_raw_hos_alpha` table, which contains alphanumeric data from the Hospital 2552-2010 form. This form is used by hospitals to report their annual costs to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The data in this table can be used to analyze trends in hospital costs and identify potential areas for cost savings or efficiency improvements.

-- The main steps of the query are:
-- 1. Aggregate the data to the hospital level by summing the `itm_alphnmrc_itm_txt` column for each unique `rpt_rec_num`.
-- 2. Calculate the year-over-year change in total costs for each hospital.
-- 3. Identify the hospitals with the largest year-over-year cost increases and decreases.
-- 4. Provide insights into the potential drivers of these cost changes.

-- The core business value of this data is the ability to:
-- - Monitor and analyze trends in hospital costs over time
-- - Identify hospitals that are effectively managing their costs
-- - Understand the factors contributing to cost changes, such as changes in service mix, labor costs, or capital investments
-- - Inform policy decisions and reimbursement strategies based on the observed cost trends

    WHEN pct_change < -0.1 THEN 'Significant Cost Decrease'

  END AS cost_change_category

ORDER BY pct_change DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- How the query works:
-- 1. The `hospital_costs` CTE aggregates the data to the hospital level (using the `rpt_rec_num` column) and calculates the total cost for each hospital-year.
-- 2. The `cost_changes` CTE calculates the year-over-year percent change in total costs for each hospital.
-- 3. The final query selects the top 10 hospitals with the largest cost changes (both increases and decreases) and categorizes them as "Significant Cost Increase", "Significant Cost Decrease", or "Moderate Cost Change".

-- Assumptions and limitations:
-- - The data in the `costreport_raw_hos_alpha` table is likely aggregated at the hospital level and does not contain patient-level information, limiting the ability to conduct granular analyses.
-- - Provider names and addresses may be anonymized or omitted, making it difficult to link this data with other datasets containing provider information.
-- - The time period covered by the data is not specified, which could limit the ability to conduct time-sensitive analyses or compare the data with other datasets from different time periods.

-- Possible extensions:
-- - Analyze the drivers of cost changes, such as changes in service mix, labor costs, or capital investments, by linking the data to other datasets (e.g., hospital characteristics, utilization data).
-- - Investigate regional variations in cost trends and the factors that contribute to these differences.
-- - Compare the reported costs to the reimbursement rates from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance providers to identify potential areas for cost savings or efficiency improvements.
-- - Develop predictive models to forecast future cost trends and identify hospitals at risk of significant cost increases.

    - Additional Notes: The query analyzes trends in hospital costs using data from the 'mimi_ws_1.cmsdataresearch.costreport_raw_hos_alpha' table. It identifies the hospitals with the largest year-over-year cost increases and decreases, providing insights into potential drivers of these cost changes. However, the data is likely aggregated at the hospital level and may not contain patient-level details, limiting the ability to conduct granular analyses. Additionally, the time period covered by the data is not specified, which could limit the ability to compare the data with other datasets from different time periods.
