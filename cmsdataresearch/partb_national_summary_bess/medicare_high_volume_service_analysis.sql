-- Business Purpose: 
-- Analyze Medicare service utilization patterns and efficiency by identifying
-- procedures with high service volumes but varying payment rates.
-- This helps healthcare providers and administrators optimize resource allocation
-- and understand service delivery patterns.

WITH service_metrics AS (
    -- Calculate payment per service and reimbursement rate for each procedure
    SELECT 
        description,
        hcpcs,
        SUM(allowed_services) as total_services,
        SUM(payment) as total_payments,
        SUM(payment) / NULLIF(SUM(allowed_services), 0) as payment_per_service,
        SUM(payment) / NULLIF(SUM(allowed_charges), 0) as reimbursement_rate
    FROM mimi_ws_1.cmsdataresearch.partb_national_summary_bess
    WHERE allowed_services > 0
    GROUP BY description, hcpcs
),
ranked_services AS (
    -- Rank procedures by volume and add utilization tier
    SELECT 
        *,
        CASE 
            WHEN total_services > 1000000 THEN 'High Volume'
            WHEN total_services > 100000 THEN 'Medium Volume'
            ELSE 'Low Volume'
        END as volume_tier
    FROM service_metrics
    WHERE payment_per_service IS NOT NULL
)
-- Final output showing key metrics for high-utilization procedures
SELECT 
    description,
    hcpcs,
    total_services,
    ROUND(payment_per_service, 2) as avg_payment_per_service,
    ROUND(reimbursement_rate * 100, 1) as reimbursement_rate_pct,
    volume_tier
FROM ranked_services
WHERE volume_tier = 'High Volume'
ORDER BY total_services DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- How it works:
-- 1. First CTE calculates key metrics per procedure
-- 2. Second CTE adds volume-based categorization
-- 3. Final query filters for high-volume procedures and presents key insights

-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- - Assumes service volume thresholds are meaningful (1M+ for high volume)
-- - Does not account for seasonal variations
-- - Aggregates across all modifiers
-- - Does not consider geographic variations

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trend analysis
-- 2. Include modifier-specific analysis for key procedures
-- 3. Add specialty-specific groupings based on HCPCS ranges
-- 4. Calculate efficiency metrics using ratio analyses
-- 5. Compare against industry benchmarks or standards

    - Additional Notes: The query emphasizes volume-based service analysis and payment efficiency, focusing on procedures with over 1 million services. The reimbursement rate calculation may need adjustment based on specific business rules or regional variations. Consider modifying volume thresholds (1M/100K) based on specific use cases.
