-- Top_10_High_Value_Procedures_Analysis.sql

-- Business Purpose: 
-- Identify the highest-value Medicare procedures by comparing allowed charges to actual payments,
-- helping healthcare organizations understand reimbursement efficiency and potential revenue optimization.
-- This analysis supports strategic planning for medical practices and facilities by highlighting
-- procedures with the best financial returns.

WITH procedure_metrics AS (
  -- Calculate key financial metrics for each procedure
  SELECT 
    description,
    hcpcs,
    SUM(allowed_services) as total_services,
    SUM(allowed_charges) as total_allowed_charges,
    SUM(payment) as total_payments,
    ROUND(SUM(payment) / SUM(allowed_charges) * 100, 2) as reimbursement_rate
  FROM mimi_ws_1.cmsdataresearch.partb_national_summary_bess
  WHERE modifier = '' -- Focus on base procedures without modifiers
  GROUP BY description, hcpcs
  HAVING SUM(allowed_services) > 1000 -- Filter for procedures with meaningful volume
),

ranked_procedures AS (
  -- Rank procedures by total payments to identify highest value ones
  SELECT 
    *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY total_payments DESC) as payment_rank
  FROM procedure_metrics
)

-- Select top 10 procedures with their key metrics
SELECT 
  description,
  hcpcs,
  FORMAT_NUMBER(total_services, 0) as volume,
  FORMAT_NUMBER(total_allowed_charges, 2) as allowed_charges,
  FORMAT_NUMBER(total_payments, 2) as payments,
  reimbursement_rate || '%' as reimb_rate
FROM ranked_procedures
WHERE payment_rank <= 10
ORDER BY payment_rank;

-- How This Query Works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to aggregate financial metrics by procedure
-- 2. Calculates reimbursement rate as percentage of payments vs allowed charges
-- 3. Ranks procedures by total payment amount
-- 4. Returns top 10 procedures with formatted metrics

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Focuses only on base procedures without modifiers
-- - Requires minimum volume of 1000 services for significance
-- - Does not account for seasonal variations or trends over time
-- - Aggregates nationally, masking regional differences

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year growth analysis
-- 2. Include modifier impact analysis
-- 3. Break down by specialty or procedure category
-- 4. Add average payment per service calculation
-- 5. Compare reimbursement rates across similar procedures
-- 6. Add filters for specific HCPCS code ranges or specialties/*
