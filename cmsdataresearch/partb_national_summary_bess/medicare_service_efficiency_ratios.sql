-- medicare_service_cost_efficiency_analysis.sql

-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyze the cost efficiency of Medicare services by comparing payment rates to allowed charges
-- and identifying services with significant payment variations. This analysis helps:
-- 1. Healthcare providers optimize their service mix
-- 2. Financial planners project revenue more accurately
-- 3. Operations teams identify services needing cost management attention

-- Main Query
WITH service_metrics AS (
  SELECT 
    description,
    hcpcs,
    SUM(allowed_services) as total_services,
    SUM(allowed_charges) as total_charges,
    SUM(payment) as total_payment,
    -- Calculate payment efficiency ratio
    ROUND(SUM(payment) / NULLIF(SUM(allowed_charges), 0) * 100, 2) as payment_ratio
  FROM mimi_ws_1.cmsdataresearch.partb_national_summary_bess
  WHERE allowed_services > 0 
    AND allowed_charges > 0
  GROUP BY description, hcpcs
)

SELECT 
  description,
  hcpcs,
  total_services,
  total_charges,
  total_payment,
  payment_ratio,
  -- Categorize payment efficiency
  CASE 
    WHEN payment_ratio >= 80 THEN 'High Efficiency'
    WHEN payment_ratio >= 60 THEN 'Medium Efficiency'
    ELSE 'Low Efficiency'
  END as efficiency_category
FROM service_metrics
WHERE total_services > 1000  -- Focus on services with meaningful volume
ORDER BY total_charges DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- How it works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to aggregate service metrics by HCPCS code
-- 2. Calculates payment efficiency ratio (payment/allowed charges)
-- 3. Categorizes services based on payment efficiency
-- 4. Filters for services with significant volume
-- 5. Returns top 100 services by total charges

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- 1. Assumes services with zero allowed charges should be excluded
-- 2. Payment ratio thresholds (80/60) are arbitrary and may need adjustment
-- 3. Minimum service volume (1000) may need adjustment based on specific analysis needs
-- 4. Analysis is at national level only
-- 5. Does not account for service complexity or regional variations

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add trending analysis by including mimi_src_file_date
-- 2. Include modifier analysis to understand impact on efficiency
-- 3. Add specialty-specific benchmarking
-- 4. Create efficiency tier analysis by volume segments
-- 5. Add cost per service calculations
-- 6. Include year-over-year variance analysis
-- 7. Add statistical analysis of payment patterns

    - Additional Notes: This query analyzes payment efficiency for high-volume Medicare services, using an 80/60 threshold for efficiency categorization. The 1000 service minimum filter ensures statistical relevance but may need adjustment for specific use cases. Payment ratio calculations exclude zero-charge records to prevent division errors.
