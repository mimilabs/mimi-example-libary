-- Medicare Part B National Summary Data Analysis

/*
Business Purpose:
The `mimi_ws_1.cmsdataresearch.partb_national_summary_bess` table provides a comprehensive summary of Medicare Part B services, charges, and payments at the national level. This data can be used to gain insights into the utilization and spending patterns of specific medical procedures and services, which is valuable for healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers.

The following query demonstrates the core business value of this table by:
1. Identifying the top 10 most frequently utilized HCPCS/CPT codes and their corresponding allowed services, charges, and payments.
2. Analyzing the impact of modifiers on the allowed charges and payments for the top HCPCS/CPT codes.
3. Calculating the percentage contribution of the top HCPCS/CPT codes to the total Medicare Part B spending.

/*
How the query works:
1. The CTE `top_codes` identifies the top 10 HCPCS/CPT codes by total allowed services, and calculates the total allowed charges and payments for each code.
2. The main query joins the `top_codes` CTE with the original table to include the modifier information, and calculates the percentage contribution of each top code to the total Medicare Part B charges and payments.

Assumptions and Limitations:
1. The data in the `partb_national_summary_bess` table is aggregated at the national level, so this analysis does not provide any insights into regional or state-level variations.
2. The table does not include any demographic information about the beneficiaries, which could be useful for understanding utilization and spending patterns across different patient populations.
3. The "Other" category for modifiers may limit the granularity of the analysis for specific modifiers with low utilization.

Possible Extensions:
1. Analyze the impact of specific modifiers on the allowed charges and payments for the top HCPCS/CPT codes.
2. Investigate any changes in the top HCPCS/CPT codes and their utilization patterns over time by querying the data from multiple years.
3. Combine this data with other datasets, such as provider-level or geographic information, to explore more nuanced research questions about Medicare Part B utilization and spending.
