-- Skilled Nursing Facility Cost Report Analysis

/*
Business Purpose:
The skilled nursing facility (SNF) cost report data in the `mimi_ws_1.cmsdataresearch.costreport_raw_snf_nmrc` table provides valuable insights into the financial performance and operational metrics of SNFs participating in the Medicare program. By analyzing this data, we can gain a deeper understanding of the cost structures, revenue sources, and utilization patterns of SNFs, which can inform decision-making and policymaking in the long-term care industry.

ORDER BY

/*
How the Query Works:
1. The query selects the key columns from the `costreport_raw_snf_nmrc` table, which include the report record number, worksheet code, line number, column number, and the reported numeric value.
2. The `WHERE` clause filters the data to focus on the specific worksheets (S-3, A, and C) that contain the most relevant financial and utilization data.
3. The results are ordered by the snf_report_id, worksheet_code, line_number, and column_number to make it easier to analyze the data in a structured manner.

Assumptions and Limitations:
- The data in the `costreport_raw_snf_nmrc` table is not anonymized, which may limit the ability to share the data publicly without proper safeguards.
- The data represents a snapshot of the cost report submissions and may not capture all updates or changes made to the reports after the initial submission.
- The accuracy and completeness of the data depend on the quality of the cost reports submitted by the SNFs, which may vary in reporting practices and potentially include errors or inconsistencies.
- The table focuses primarily on financial and utilization metrics and does not include detailed clinical or quality-related information about the SNFs.

Possible Extensions:
1. Calculate key financial and operational metrics (e.g., cost per patient day, revenue per patient day, occupancy rates) by aggregating the data across different worksheets and grouping by relevant dimensions (e.g., provider characteristics, geographic region, ownership type).
2. Analyze trends and changes in the financial performance and utilization patterns of SNFs over time, and identify the factors contributing to these changes.
3. Investigate the relationship between patient mix (e.g., proportion of Medicare, Medicaid, and private pay patients) and the financial viability of SNFs.
4. Assess the impact of specific reimbursement policies or payment models on the cost structures and service delivery of SNFs.
5. Explore the correlation between staffing levels, labor costs, and the quality of care provided by SNFs.
