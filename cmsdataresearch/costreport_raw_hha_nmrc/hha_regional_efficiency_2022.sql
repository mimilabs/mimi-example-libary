-- Title: Home Health Agency Geographic Performance Analysis

-- Business Purpose:
-- This query analyzes HHA financial performance metrics by geographic regions to:
-- - Identify regional variations in operational efficiency
-- - Support market expansion and optimization decisions
-- - Enable benchmarking against regional peers
-- - Guide resource allocation strategies

WITH regional_performance AS (
  -- Extract base financial data from cost report worksheets
  SELECT 
    rpt_rec_num,
    wksht_cd,
    line_num,
    SUBSTRING(rpt_rec_num, 1, 2) as state_code,
    itm_val_num,
    mimi_src_file_date
  FROM mimi_ws_1.cmsdataresearch.costreport_raw_hha_nmrc
  WHERE 
    -- Focus on key financial indicators from worksheet F
    wksht_cd = 'F' 
    -- Filter to most recent reporting period
    AND YEAR(mimi_src_file_date) >= 2022
    -- Target revenue and cost lines
    AND line_num IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 
)

SELECT 
  state_code,
  COUNT(DISTINCT rpt_rec_num) as num_agencies,
  -- Calculate key financial metrics
  AVG(CASE WHEN line_num = 1 THEN itm_val_num END) as avg_total_revenue,
  AVG(CASE WHEN line_num = 2 THEN itm_val_num END) as avg_operating_costs,
  -- Calculate efficiency ratio
  AVG(CASE WHEN line_num = 1 THEN itm_val_num END) / 
    NULLIF(AVG(CASE WHEN line_num = 2 THEN itm_val_num END), 0) as revenue_cost_ratio
FROM regional_performance
GROUP BY state_code
HAVING num_agencies >= 5  -- Only include states with meaningful sample sizes
ORDER BY revenue_cost_ratio DESC;

-- How it works:
-- 1. Creates CTE to extract and transform relevant financial data
-- 2. Derives state code from provider number (first 2 digits)
-- 3. Calculates average revenue, costs and efficiency metrics by state
-- 4. Filters to ensure statistical significance

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - State codes derived from provider numbers are accurate
-- - Sample sizes vary by state which may impact comparability
-- - Does not account for differences in patient mix or urban/rural status
-- - Limited to agencies reporting in most recent period

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add trend analysis by comparing multiple years
-- 2. Include facility size/volume metrics for better segmentation
-- 3. Incorporate quality metrics for value-based analysis
-- 4. Add urban/rural designations for sub-regional insights
-- 5. Compare against national benchmarks

    - Additional Notes: State-level aggregation may mask important sub-regional variations. Consider adding metropolitan statistical area (MSA) analysis for urban markets. Revenue/cost ratio calculations should be validated against industry standard formulas.
