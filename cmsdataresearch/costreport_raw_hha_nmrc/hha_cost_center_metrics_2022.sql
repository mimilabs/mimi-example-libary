Title: Home Health Agency Cost Center Analysis - Core Metrics
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes key financial metrics across Home Health Agency cost centers
to provide insights into operational costs and resource utilization patterns.
The analysis helps identify cost variations and potential areas for optimization.

/*****************************************************************************************
How This Query Works:
1. Creates a CTE to calculate basic statistics for each worksheet/line combination
2. Filters for most recent complete year and valid cost center worksheets
3. Aggregates key metrics including mean, standard deviation, and value ranges
4. Calculates coefficient of variation to identify areas of high variability
5. Filters for lines with sufficient data points for meaningful analysis

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes worksheets A, B, C contain relevant cost center information
- Limited to 2022 data for current snapshot analysis
- Requires at least 10 reports per line for inclusion
- Does not account for facility size or geographic variations
- Raw values used without adjusting for inflation or market factors

Possible Extensions:
1. Add year-over-year trend analysis
2. Include geographic grouping using provider numbers
3. Segment by facility size or ownership type
4. Add statistical outlier detection
5. Incorporate revenue metrics for ROI analysis
6. Create peer group comparisons
