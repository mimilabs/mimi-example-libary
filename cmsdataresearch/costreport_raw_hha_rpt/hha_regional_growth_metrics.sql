-- How it works:
-- 1. First CTE gets yearly provider counts by state
-- 2. Second CTE calculates year-over-year changes
-- 3. Final query adds market status classification and filters/sorts results

-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- - Uses provider numbers for state identification (first 2 digits)
-- - New provider determination based on initial report flag
-- - Growth metrics may be affected by reporting delays or missing data
-- - Does not account for provider size/volume differences

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add provider control type dimension to track ownership expansion patterns
-- 2. Include metropolitan statistical area (MSA) analysis
-- 3. Add financial metrics to identify high-value markets
-- 4. Incorporate demographic data to assess market potential
-- 5. Create predictive model for market entry opportunities

    - Additional Notes: Query uses provider number prefix as state identifier which may need validation against a proper state mapping table. Growth calculations require at least two years of data, starting from 2018. Market status thresholds (Â±5%) are arbitrary and may need adjustment based on industry standards.
