-- Medicare Hospital Cost Report Submission Timeliness Analysis
-- Business Purpose: Analyze hospital compliance and timeliness in cost report submissions to:
-- - Identify patterns in reporting delays that may impact CMS reimbursement
-- - Monitor operational efficiency of fiscal intermediary processing
-- - Support revenue cycle optimization through better report submission timing
-- - Track facilities that may need additional support or oversight

-- How this works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to calculate key timing metrics for each cost report submission
-- 2. Applies data quality filters to ensure valid dates
-- 3. Aggregates metrics by fiscal year to show trends
-- 4. Includes distribution analysis through quartile calculations

-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- - Assumes fi_rcpt_dt and proc_dt are reliable indicators of actual submission timing
-- - 150 day threshold for "late" submissions based on typical CMS guidelines
-- - Limited to reports from 2018 forward for recent relevance
-- - Does not account for amended submissions or special circumstances

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic analysis by joining provider reference data
-- 2. Compare timing patterns across different control types
-- 3. Identify specific providers with consistent late submissions
-- 4. Calculate financial impact of late submissions
-- 5. Create monthly trending for more granular analysis
-- 6. Add seasonal patterns analysis for submission timing

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on tracking Medicare cost report submission efficiency and compliance patterns. Requires valid date fields (fi_rcpt_dt, proc_dt) and assumes standard 150-day filing deadline. Best used for operational monitoring and identifying systematic reporting delays.
