-- Fiscal Year Reporting Cycle Analysis for Hospital Operations
-- Business Purpose: 
-- - Track hospital operations periods and identify any gaps or overlaps in reporting cycles
-- - Support fiscal planning and operational oversight by CMS administrators
-- - Assess hospital continuity and operational status through reporting patterns
-- - Enable fiscal cycle comparison across provider organizations

/* How this works:
- Creates a CTE to analyze fiscal reporting cycles by provider
- Calculates key metrics around reporting periods and continuity
- Identifies non-standard reporting cycles and gaps between periods
- Summarizes reporting patterns at the provider level

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Focuses only on finalized reports (status code 1)
- Uses 31 day threshold for identifying gaps between reporting periods
- Limited to recent 5 year window for more relevant analysis
- Assumes provider numbers remain consistent over time

Possible Extensions:
1. Add geographic analysis by joining provider location data
2. Compare reporting patterns across different control types
3. Analyze seasonal patterns in fiscal year start/end dates
4. Track changes in reporting durations over time
5. Build provider risk scores based on reporting inconsistencies

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on fiscal reporting continuity patterns and may need memory optimization when analyzing longer time periods or larger provider sets. Consider adjusting the 5-year window and 1000 row limit based on specific analysis needs. The 31-day gap threshold is configurable based on reporting requirements.
