Hospital Cost Report Analysis - Basic Provider Status Overview
 
Business Purpose:
This query provides a foundational analysis of hospital cost reporting status
and patterns over time. It helps identify:
- Active vs inactive providers
- Reporting compliance trends
- Basic provider demographics
 
This serves as a starting point for deeper financial and operational analysis.

/*************************************************************************
How this query works:
1. Creates a provider-level summary with their reporting history
2. Aggregates by provider type to show reporting patterns
3. Includes metrics for activity levels and reporting consistency

Key Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes providers should report annually
- "Active" status based on reports in last 2 years (730 days)
- Does not account for provider mergers/acquisitions
- Limited to high-level provider type analysis

Possible Extensions:
1. Add geographic analysis by joining provider location data
2. Include financial metrics like total charges or costs
3. Add trend analysis showing reporting patterns over time
4. Compare reporting timeliness across provider types
5. Build provider risk scoring based on reporting patterns

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on provider reporting patterns with key metrics like reporting frequency and recency. The 730-day lookback period for 'active' status is configurable based on business needs. Provider control type codes may need reference data for meaningful interpretation. Performance may be impacted with very large datasets due to the distinct count operations.
