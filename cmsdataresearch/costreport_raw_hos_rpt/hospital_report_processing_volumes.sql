-- Hospital Cost Report Volume and Processing Trends Analysis
--
-- Business Purpose: Understand operational efficiency and workload for cost report processing by:
-- - Tracking monthly/quarterly volume of cost report submissions 
-- - Identifying processing backlogs and bottlenecks
-- - Supporting resource planning for fiscal intermediaries
-- - Monitoring regional variations in report processing

WITH monthly_volumes AS (
    -- Calculate submission and processing volumes by month
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('month', fi_rcpt_dt) AS submission_month,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', proc_dt) AS processing_month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT rpt_rec_num) AS report_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT prvdr_num) AS provider_count,
        AVG(DATEDIFF(day, fi_rcpt_dt, proc_dt)) AS avg_processing_days
    FROM mimi_ws_1.cmsdataresearch.costreport_raw_hos_rpt
    WHERE fi_rcpt_dt >= '2018-01-01'  -- Focus on recent years
    AND fi_rcpt_dt IS NOT NULL
    AND proc_dt IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', fi_rcpt_dt), 
             DATE_TRUNC('month', proc_dt)
),

processing_stats AS (
    -- Calculate key processing metrics
    SELECT
        submission_month,
        report_count,
        provider_count,
        avg_processing_days,
        LAG(report_count) OVER (ORDER BY submission_month) AS prev_month_volume,
        AVG(report_count) OVER (ORDER BY submission_month ROWS BETWEEN 12 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_12m_avg
    FROM monthly_volumes
)

SELECT 
    submission_month,
    report_count,
    provider_count,
    avg_processing_days,
    -- Calculate month-over-month change
    ((report_count - prev_month_volume) * 100.0 / NULLIF(prev_month_volume, 0)) AS mom_volume_change_pct,
    -- Compare against rolling average
    ((report_count - rolling_12m_avg) * 100.0 / rolling_12m_avg) AS variance_from_12m_avg_pct
FROM processing_stats
ORDER BY submission_month DESC;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. First CTE aggregates monthly submission and processing volumes
-- 2. Second CTE calculates rolling averages and period-over-period changes
-- 3. Final SELECT adds comparative metrics for trend analysis

-- Assumptions and limitations:
-- - Assumes fi_rcpt_dt and proc_dt are reliable indicators of actual timing
-- - Limited to records with non-null dates
-- - Rolling averages may be affected by seasonal patterns
-- - Does not account for report complexity or size

-- Possible extensions:
-- - Add geographic grouping to identify regional processing centers
-- - Include provider control type breakdown for submission patterns
-- - Add fiscal year analysis to identify seasonal patterns
-- - Incorporate report status codes to track revision frequencies
-- - Add workload distribution analysis across fiscal intermediaries

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on operational metrics for cost report processing, providing insights into submission volumes and processing efficiency. The analysis is most reliable for data from 2018 onwards and requires both receipt and processing dates to be populated. The rolling 12-month average calculation may show incomplete trends at the edges of the date range.
