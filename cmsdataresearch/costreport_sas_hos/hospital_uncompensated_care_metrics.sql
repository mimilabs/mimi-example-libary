/* Hospital Uncompensated Care Analysis

Business Purpose:
This analysis examines uncompensated and charity care provided by hospitals to understand:
- The financial burden of providing care to uninsured/underinsured patients
- Geographic and demographic patterns in charity care delivery
- Impact on hospital financial sustainability
- Opportunities for policy and program interventions

The results help healthcare executives and policymakers:
- Allocate resources for serving vulnerable populations
- Design financial assistance programs
- Identify areas needing additional support
- Develop sustainable charity care policies

/* How the Query Works:
1. Selects core uncompensated care metrics along with contextual hospital information
2. Calculates percentage ratios to normalize by hospital size
3. Filters for complete records with uncompensated care data
4. Orders results by uncompensated care amount to highlight biggest impacts

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Relies on accurate self-reporting of uncompensated care costs
- Does not account for differences in cost accounting methods
- Limited to one fiscal year snapshot
- May not capture all forms of unreimbursed care
- Rural/urban classifications may oversimplify local contexts

Possible Extensions:
1. Add year-over-year trend analysis of uncompensated care growth
2. Include demographic analysis of surrounding communities
3. Compare uncompensated care levels across different hospital ownership types
4. Analyze correlation with local insurance coverage rates
5. Create geographic visualizations of charity care distribution
6. Develop predictive models for uncompensated care risk
7. Calculate detailed financial impact metrics

    - Additional Notes: Query performs well for analysis of charity care patterns but may require memory optimization when analyzing full national datasets due to large record counts. Consider adding date range filters when running against complete historical data.
