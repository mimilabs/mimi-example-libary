    - Additional Notes: This SQL query analyzes the Hospital Cost Reports 2552-2010 SAS Version table to provide insights into hospital cost, revenue, and utilization trends. The analysis is limited to the most recent fiscal year due to data availability constraints, and trends over time cannot be assessed without incorporating multiple years of data.
