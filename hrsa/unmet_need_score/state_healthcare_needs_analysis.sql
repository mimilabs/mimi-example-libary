Title: High Unmet Healthcare Need Analysis by State
 
Business Purpose:
- Identify states with significant unmet healthcare needs based on HRSA's Unmet Need Score (UNS)
- Highlight key health and socioeconomic factors in areas with high unmet needs
- Support data-driven resource allocation and healthcare planning decisions

-- Main analysis: Get states with highest average unmet need scores and key indicators
WITH state_metrics AS (
  SELECT 
    state,
    -- Calculate average UNS and population metrics
    ROUND(AVG(zcta_uns), 2) as avg_uns_score,
    SUM(population_size) as total_population,
    COUNT(DISTINCT zip_code) as num_zip_codes,
    
    -- Calculate averages of key health indicators
    ROUND(AVG(uninsured * 100), 1) as avg_pct_uninsured,
    ROUND(AVG(below_poverty_level), 1) as avg_pct_poverty,
    ROUND(AVG(life_expectancy), 1) as avg_life_expectancy,
    ROUND(AVG(health_center_penetration * 100), 1) as avg_pct_health_center_coverage
  FROM mimi_ws_1.hrsa.unmet_need_score
  GROUP BY state
)

SELECT 
  state,
  avg_uns_score,
  total_population,
  num_zip_codes,
  avg_pct_uninsured,
  avg_pct_poverty,

FROM state_metrics

/*******************************************************
How it works:
1. Groups data by state to calculate state-level metrics
2. Computes average UNS score and key health/demographic indicators
3. Returns top 10 states with highest unmet needs

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Uses simple averages that don't account for population weighting
- Limited to ZIP code level aggregation
- Point-in-time snapshot based on latest data
- Focuses on state-level patterns which may mask local variations

Possible Extensions:
1. Add temporal analysis to track changes over time
2. Include geographic clustering to identify regional patterns
3. Create risk categories based on UNS scores
4. Add correlation analysis between UNS and specific factors
5. Build county-level or regional aggregations
6. Include demographic breakdowns of affected populations

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on state-level unmet healthcare needs using HRSA's UNS metric. Results should be interpreted with population size context since averages across ZIP codes may not reflect population-weighted reality. Consider adding population weights for more accurate state-level comparisons.
