-- The query retrieves the top 10 mental health HPSAs with the highest HPSA scores, which indicate the 
-- most severe provider shortages. It provides key metrics such as the HPSA population, the number of 
-- additional mental health providers needed, the provider-to-population ratio, the primary state, 
-- the urban/rural classification, and the percentage of the population living below the poverty line.

-- This information can be used to:
-- 1. Identify the geographic areas with the greatest need for mental health services and target 
--    resources and funding to these high-priority areas.
-- 2. Understand the relationship between mental health provider shortages and demographic factors 
--    like poverty, which can inform strategies to address the underlying social determinants of health.
-- 3. Analyze differences in provider shortages between rural and urban areas, and develop tailored 
--    solutions to improve access to mental health care in underserved communities.
-- 4. Track changes in mental health provider shortages over time and evaluate the impact of 
--    interventions or policy changes.

-- Assumptions:
-- 1. The HPSA for Mental Health dataset is up-to-date and accurately reflects the current state of 
--    mental health provider shortages.
-- 2. The HPSA score and other metrics provided in the dataset are reliable indicators of the severity 
--    of the provider shortage and the need for mental health services.

-- Limitations:
-- 1. The dataset does not include information on the quality or effectiveness of mental health services 
--    provided in each shortage area.
-- 2. There may be a lag between when changes occur in the field and when they are reflected in the 
--    updated dataset.

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Analyze trends in mental health provider shortages over time, such as changes in HPSA scores, 
--    designated areas, and provider-to-population ratios.
-- 2. Investigate the relationship between mental health provider shortages and other socioeconomic 
--    factors, such as education levels, unemployment rates, and access to transportation.
-- 3. Explore the impact of federal or state-level programs and initiatives aimed at addressing mental 
--    health provider shortages, and evaluate their effectiveness.
-- 4. Combine the HPSA for Mental Health dataset with other data sources, such as mental health 
--    utilization or outcomes data, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the mental health 
--    landscape in the United States.
