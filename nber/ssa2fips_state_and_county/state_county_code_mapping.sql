Title: SSA to FIPS County Code Mapping Analysis
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes the mapping between SSA and FIPS geographic coding systems
at the county level, which is critical for:
- Integrating data from different government sources
- Ensuring consistent geographic analysis
- Supporting demographic and economic research

-- Main Query
WITH county_stats AS (
  -- Get basic stats about code mappings per state
  SELECT 
    state_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT fipscounty) as num_counties,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ssa_code) as num_ssa_codes,
    COUNT(DISTINCT fy2023cbsa) as num_cbsa_regions
  FROM mimi_ws_1.nber.ssa2fips_state_and_county
  GROUP BY state_name
)

SELECT
  state_name,
  num_counties,
  num_ssa_codes,
  num_cbsa_regions,
  -- Calculate completeness of mapping
  ROUND(num_ssa_codes::float / num_counties * 100, 1) as pct_counties_with_ssa
FROM county_stats
WHERE num_counties > 0  -- Exclude any empty states
ORDER BY num_counties DESC
LIMIT 10;

/*******************************************************************************
How it works:
1. Creates temp table with aggregated stats per state
2. Calculates percentage of counties with SSA codes
3. Shows top 10 states by number of counties

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes current data is complete and accurate
- Limited to fiscal year 2023 CBSA definitions
- Does not account for historical changes

Possible Extensions:
1. Add temporal analysis using different fiscal year CBSA codes
2. Include population or economic data to weight the analysis
3. Create geographic visualizations of the mappings
4. Analyze specific metropolitan areas or regions
5. Add error checking for mismatched or missing codes

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on state-level aggregation of geographic code mappings between SSA and FIPS systems. Results are limited to top 10 states by county count. Consider adding WHERE clauses if analysis of specific regions or time periods is needed.
