-- Analyzing Home Value Trends by Zip Code

/*
This query analyzes the home value trends in the `mimi_ws_1.zillow.homevalue_zip` table,
which provides a comprehensive time-series dataset of Zillow Home Value Indices (ZHVI)
at the zip code level.

The key business value of this data is to enable real estate professionals, investors,
and policymakers to understand the historical and current state of the housing market
at a granular, zip code level. This can inform decision-making around property
investments, development, and housing policy.

/*
This query demonstrates the core business value of the `homevalue_zip` table by:

1. Selecting key geographic dimensions (state, zip, city, county) to enable analysis
   of home value trends at a granular, local level.
2. Retrieving the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI), which is the primary metric of
   home values provided in the dataset.
3. Filtering the data to a specific state (California in this example) to show how
   the data can be used to analyze regional housing market dynamics.
4. Ordering the results by the most recent date and limiting to the top 10 rows to
   highlight the latest home value data.

Assumptions and Limitations:
- The data is aggregated at the zip code level, which may not provide the level
  of detail needed for certain research questions.
- The ZHVI is a proprietary metric from Zillow, so it may have limitations or
  biases compared to other home value indicators.
- The dataset does not include additional property-level characteristics that
  could influence home values, such as size, age, or amenities.

Possible Extensions:
- Analyze home value trends over time, such as year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter
  changes, to identify market cycles and growth patterns.
- Compare home value appreciation between different housing types (single-family,
  condo, etc.) or number of bedrooms to understand segmentation within the market.
- Identify zip codes with the highest or lowest home values, as well as those
  experiencing the fastest or slowest appreciation, to pinpoint areas of interest.
- Combine this data with other datasets, such as economic indicators or
  demographic trends, to gain a more holistic understanding of the factors
  driving home value changes.
