-- Exploring the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) at the Census Tract Level

/*
  Business Purpose:
  The `adi_censustract` table provides valuable insights into the socioeconomic
  conditions of neighborhoods across the United States. By analyzing this data,
  we can identify areas with high levels of deprivation, which can inform
  targeted interventions and resource allocation to address disparities and
  improve overall community wellbeing.

SELECT
  fips_censustract,
  adi_natrank_avg,
  adi_staternk_avg,
  adi_natrank_median,
  adi_staternk_median
FROM mimi_ws_1.neighborhoodatlas.adi_censustract
WHERE adi_natrank_avg >= 80
  AND adi_staternk_avg >= 80
ORDER BY adi_natrank_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;

/*
  Explanation of the query:
  1. The query selects the FIPS code for the census tract, the average national
     and state ADI ranks, and the median national and state ADI ranks.
  2. It filters the results to include only census tracts with an average
     national and state ADI rank of 80 or higher, indicating high levels of
     socioeconomic deprivation.
  3. The results are sorted in descending order by the average national ADI
     rank, so the most deprived census tracts are displayed first.
  4. The LIMIT 10 clause returns the top 10 most deprived census tracts based
     on the criteria.

  Business Value:
  This query provides a starting point for identifying the most disadvantaged
  census tracts in the data. By focusing on the areas with the highest levels
  of deprivation, as indicated by the national and state ADI ranks, decision-
  makers can prioritize these neighborhoods for targeted interventions, such as
  increased social services, infrastructure improvements, or economic
  development initiatives. This can help address disparities and improve
  overall community wellbeing.

  Assumptions and Limitations:
  - The data in the `adi_censustract` table is a snapshot in time and may not
    reflect the most current socioeconomic conditions.
  - The ADI is an area-level measure, so there may be heterogeneity within each
    census tract that is not captured by this data.
  - The query focuses only on the most deprived census tracts, but there may
    be value in analyzing the full range of ADI scores to understand patterns
    and trends across different levels of deprivation.

  Possible Extensions:
  1. Expand the analysis to compare the distribution of ADI scores across
     different states or regions, which could help identify geographic
     disparities.
  2. Investigate the relationship between the ADI and other socioeconomic
     or health indicators, such as educational attainment, unemployment,
     or chronic disease prevalence.
  3. Analyze how the ADI has changed over time, which could provide insights
     into the dynamics of neighborhood socioeconomic conditions.
  4. Explore the use of the ADI data in conjunction with other spatial data,
     such as census demographic information or local infrastructure, to
     develop more comprehensive models of community wellbeing.

    - Additional Notes: This query provides a starting point for identifying the most disadvantaged census tracts based on the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) data. It focuses on the areas with the highest levels of socioeconomic deprivation, which can inform targeted interventions and resource allocation. However, the data represents a snapshot in time and may not reflect the most current conditions, and the ADI is an area-level measure that may not capture within-tract heterogeneity.
