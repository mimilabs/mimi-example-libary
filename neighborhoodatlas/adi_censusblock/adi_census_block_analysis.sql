-- ADI Census Block Analysis

-- This query demonstrates the core business value of the `mimi_ws_1.neighborhoodatlas.adi_censusblock` table by analyzing the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) data at the census block group level. The ADI is a widely used measure of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage, which can provide valuable insights into health disparities and socioeconomic inequalities within communities.

-- The key business value of this table is the ability to:
-- 1. Identify the most socioeconomically deprived areas within a region or state
-- 2. Understand how health outcomes and access to healthcare services may vary based on neighborhood ADI rankings
-- 3. Evaluate the effectiveness of community-level interventions or policies aimed at reducing socioeconomic disparities

This query retrieves the top 10 most deprived census block groups (based on national ADI ranking) for the specified regions (Los Angeles County, CA and Harris County, TX). The key columns included are:

- `fips`: The unique census block group identifier
- `adi_natrank`: The national ranking of the census block group based on the ADI
- `adi_staternk`: The state-specific ranking of the census block group based on the ADI
- `nat_qdi`: The national ADI quintile deprivation index, which categorizes the census block group into one of five deprivation levels (1 = least deprived, 5 = most deprived)
- `state_qdi`: The state-specific ADI quintile deprivation index
- `mimi_src_file_date`: The date the source data was prepared or published, which can be used to track changes in ADI rankings over time

This query can serve as a foundation for further analysis and extensions, such as:

1. Joining the ADI data with other datasets (e.g., health outcomes, healthcare accessibility, environmental factors) to explore the relationships between socioeconomic disadvantage and various community-level indicators.
2. Visualizing the spatial distribution of ADI rankings within the selected regions using mapping tools or GIS software.
3. Analyzing changes in ADI rankings over time to evaluate the impact of community-level interventions or policy changes.
4. Comparing ADI rankings between urban and rural areas to understand the implications for health equity in different geographic settings.

Assumptions and limitations:
- The ADI data in this table is derived from American Community Survey (ACS) estimates and may be subject to sampling and non-sampling errors.
- The ADI is a relative measure of deprivation and does not provide absolute thresholds for determining disadvantage.
- The table represents a snapshot of the ADI based on the ACS data used in its construction and may not reflect the most recent socioeconomic conditions.
- The table does not contain any personally identifiable information or specific provider names and addresses, as it is aggregated to the census block group level.

    - Additional Notes: This query analyzes the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) data at the census block group level, allowing users to identify the most socioeconomically deprived areas, understand health outcome variations, and evaluate the effectiveness of community-level interventions. The analysis is limited to the specified regions (Los Angeles County, CA and Harris County, TX) and may not reflect the most recent socioeconomic conditions.
