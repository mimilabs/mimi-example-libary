-- Title: Medicare Claims Seasonal Utilization Analysis

-- Business Purpose:
-- This query analyzes seasonal patterns in Medicare carrier claims to help:
-- - Identify peak service periods and capacity planning needs
-- - Understand seasonal variations in healthcare utilization
-- - Support staffing and resource allocation decisions
-- - Guide preventive care campaign timing

WITH monthly_claims AS (
    -- Aggregate claims by month and year
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('month', clm_from_dt) as service_month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT clm_id) as claim_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT bene_id) as unique_patients,
        SUM(line_srvc_cnt) as total_services,
        SUM(line_nch_pmt_amt) as total_payments
    FROM mimi_ws_1.synmedpuf.carrier
    WHERE clm_from_dt IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', clm_from_dt)
),
seasonal_metrics AS (
    -- Calculate seasonal metrics
    SELECT 
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM service_month) as month_number,
        TO_CHAR(service_month, 'Month') as month_name,
        AVG(claim_count) as avg_monthly_claims,
        AVG(unique_patients) as avg_monthly_patients,
        AVG(total_services) as avg_monthly_services,
        AVG(total_payments) as avg_monthly_payments
    FROM monthly_claims
    GROUP BY 
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM service_month),
        TO_CHAR(service_month, 'Month')
)
SELECT 
    month_number,
    month_name,
    ROUND(avg_monthly_claims) as avg_claims,
    ROUND(avg_monthly_patients) as avg_patients,
    ROUND(avg_monthly_services) as avg_services,
    ROUND(avg_monthly_payments, 2) as avg_payments,
    -- Calculate relative seasonal intensity
    ROUND(100 * avg_monthly_claims / 
        (SELECT AVG(avg_monthly_claims) FROM seasonal_metrics), 2) as claims_seasonal_index
FROM seasonal_metrics
ORDER BY month_number;

-- How it works:
-- 1. First CTE aggregates claims data by month
-- 2. Second CTE calculates average metrics for each calendar month
-- 3. Final query adds a seasonal index comparing each month to overall average
-- 4. Results show monthly patterns in healthcare utilization

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes claim dates are reliable indicators of service timing
-- - Does not account for claim submission delays
-- - Seasonal patterns may vary by geography or specialty
-- - Synthetic data may not perfectly reflect real seasonal variations

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic breakdown to identify regional seasonal patterns
-- 2. Split analysis by provider specialty or service type
-- 3. Include weather data correlation analysis
-- 4. Add year-over-year trend analysis
-- 5. Create forecasting model based on seasonal patterns

    - Additional Notes: Query provides a standardized monthly index (100 = average) to easily identify high and low utilization periods. Consider running with at least 24 months of data for reliable seasonal patterns. May need index calculation adjustment if data spans partial years.
