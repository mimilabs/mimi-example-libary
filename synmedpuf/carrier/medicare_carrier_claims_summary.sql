Title: Medicare Carrier Claims Analysis - Core Payment and Service Metrics

Business Purpose:
This query analyzes key metrics from Medicare carrier claims (non-institutional 
providers like physicians) to understand:
- Total payments and charges
- Most common services/procedures
- Provider specialties and locations
- Payment patterns across different service types

This provides insights into Medicare spending, service utilization, and provider 
patterns that can inform policy and operational decisions.

/*******************************************************************************
How It Works:
1. claim_metrics CTE - Aggregates core payment/utilization metrics by year
2. top_services CTE - Identifies most frequently performed procedures
3. provider_analysis CTE - Analyzes provider specialty and geographic patterns
4. Final query combines these views into a comprehensive summary

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes claim dates and payment amounts are valid/clean
- Limited to available years in the dataset
- Does not account for changes in procedure codes over time
- Provider specialty codes assumed to be consistent

Possible Extensions:
1. Add temporal analysis (seasonality, trends)
2. Include diagnosis code analysis
3. Add geographic heat mapping
4. Compare allowed vs submitted charges ratios
5. Analyze claim denial patterns
6. Add beneficiary demographic analysis

    - Additional Notes: Query processes large amounts of Medicare claims data and may require optimization for large datasets. Performance can be improved by adding appropriate indexes on clm_from_dt, hcpcs_cd, and prvdr_spclty columns. Consider partitioning by claim_year if working with multiple years of data.
