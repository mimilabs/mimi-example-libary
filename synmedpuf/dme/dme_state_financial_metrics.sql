Title: DME Claims Analysis - Key Financial Metrics by State 

Business Purpose:
This query analyzes Medicare Durable Medical Equipment (DME) claims to understand:
- Total claims and financial values by state
- Average reimbursement rates and patient costs
- Payment patterns and cost variations across states

This helps stakeholders:
- Monitor DME spending and reimbursement patterns 
- Identify potential cost saving opportunities
- Ensure appropriate payments and detect anomalies

/*******************************************************************************
How this query works:
1. Creates CTE to aggregate key metrics by state
2. Calculates financial totals and averages
3. Formats final output with derived metrics and ratios

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes prvdr_state_cd is valid state identifier
- Null states are excluded
- Does not account for denied claims
- No time period filtering applied

Possible Extensions:
1. Add time-based trending:
   - Group by year/month
   - Calculate year-over-year changes

2. Add diagnosis analysis:
   - Join with diagnosis codes
   - Group by medical conditions

3. Add provider analysis:
   - Group by provider specialty
   - Calculate provider-level metrics

4. Add geographic clustering:
   - Group states by region
   - Compare regional patterns

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on state-level DME claim metrics and payment patterns. Handles null values with NULLIF() to prevent division by zero errors. Consider adding WHERE clause filters for specific date ranges if analyzing a particular time period. Large aggregations may impact performance on full datasets.
