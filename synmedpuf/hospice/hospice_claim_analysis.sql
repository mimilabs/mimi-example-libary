-- This query provides a high-level overview of the hospice claims data, including:
-- 1. Basic claim information: claim ID, beneficiary ID, service dates, primary diagnosis code
-- 2. Hospice-specific details: hospice start date, number of hospice benefit periods
-- 3. Claim payment and charges: Medicare payment amount, total claim charges
-- 4. Provider information: provider number, state, attending physician NPI
-- 5. Discharge status: patient discharge status and date

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - The data is synthetic, so the insights may not reflect real-world patterns and trends.
-- - The query focuses on a sample of 1,000 recent claims, which may not be representative of the full dataset.
-- - Additional analysis may be needed to understand the longer-term utilization patterns and outcomes for hospice beneficiaries.

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Analyze the average length of stay in hospice care by primary diagnosis or other patient characteristics.
-- 2. Investigate the geographic variation in hospice utilization rates across different states or regions.
-- 3. Explore the relationship between hospice utilization and other healthcare services, such as inpatient hospital stays or emergency department visits.
-- 4. Compare hospice utilization and outcomes between beneficiaries in traditional Medicare and those in Medicare Advantage plans.
-- 5. Identify the most common types of hospice services provided and how they vary based on patient characteristics or diagnoses.
