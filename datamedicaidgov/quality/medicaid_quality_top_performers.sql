Healthcare Quality Measures Analysis - Core Performance Indicators

Business Purpose:
This query analyzes key performance metrics across states for critical healthcare
quality measures in Medicaid/CHIP programs. It helps identify high and low performing
states, track year-over-year trends, and compare against national medians to highlight
areas needing improvement.

The analysis focuses on measures where "Higher rates are better" to identify
successful healthcare delivery patterns.

/*
How the Query Works:
1. CTE creates ranked_measures that:
   - Filters for valid, recent data points
   - Calculates variance from median
   - Ranks states for each measure/year
2. Main SELECT:
   - Shows key metrics for top performing states
   - Adds performance tier classification
   - Orders results for easy analysis

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Focuses only on measures where "higher is better"
- Limited to most recent 3 years
- Rankings assume all reported rates are comparable
- Does not account for state-specific factors that may impact rates

Possible Extensions:
1. Add trend analysis to show year-over-year rate changes
2. Include population size/demographics context
3. Break down by specific domains (e.g., preventive care)
4. Add statistical significance testing for rate differences
5. Create peer groups of similar states for fairer comparisons
6. Include cost effectiveness metrics where available

    - Additional Notes: Query identifies top-performing states in healthcare quality measures across Medicaid/CHIP programs. Note that it only analyzes measures where higher rates indicate better performance and requires recent data (2020 onwards) with valid state rates and medians. Results are most meaningful when comparing states with similar population characteristics and healthcare infrastructure.
