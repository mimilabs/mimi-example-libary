-- Analyze Partial Gap Coverage for Medicare Part D Plans

-- This query provides insights into the partial gap coverage offered by Medicare Part D plans, which is crucial information for beneficiaries to understand their out-of-pocket costs during the coverage gap phase.

-- The key steps are:
-- 1. Identify the unique plan-drug combinations that have partial gap coverage
-- 2. Summarize the distribution of these plan-drug combinations by plan and drug

SELECT
  p.contract_id,
  p.plan_id,
  p.rxcui,
  COUNT(*) AS plan_drug_count
FROM mimi_ws_1.prescriptiondrugplan.partial_gap_coverage p
GROUP BY
  p.contract_id,
  p.plan_id,
  p.rxcui
ORDER BY plan_drug_count DESC;

-- This query allows us to understand which Medicare Part D plans offer partial gap coverage for specific drugs (identified by their RxCUI). The key business value is:

-- 1. Identifying the plan-drug combinations that have partial gap coverage. This information can help beneficiaries understand their potential out-of-pocket costs for specific medications during the coverage gap phase.
-- 2. Summarizing the distribution of these plan-drug combinations. This can reveal which plans offer the most comprehensive partial gap coverage and which drugs are more likely to have this type of coverage.
-- 3. Providing context by linking to related tables (plan information, excluded drugs, beneficiary cost), which can further enrich the analysis.

-- Assumptions and limitations:
-- - The data represents a snapshot in time and may not reflect changes made by plans during the contract year.
-- - The table does not provide specific cost-sharing details for the drugs with partial gap coverage.
-- - The RxCUI does not reveal the brand name or manufacturer of the drug.

-- Possible extensions:
-- - Analyze the relationship between partial gap coverage and plan characteristics (e.g., premium, overall beneficiary satisfaction).
-- - Investigate the types of drugs (e.g., by therapeutic class) that are more likely to have partial gap coverage.
-- - Explore how the availability of partial gap coverage varies across plan types (e.g., standalone prescription drug plans vs. Medicare Advantage plans).

    - Additional Notes: This query provides valuable insights into the partial gap coverage offered by Medicare Part D plans, which is crucial information for beneficiaries to understand their potential out-of-pocket costs during the coverage gap phase. It identifies the unique plan-drug combinations that have partial gap coverage and summarizes the distribution of these combinations. The query can be further extended to analyze the relationship between partial gap coverage and other plan characteristics, as well as explore patterns in the types of drugs that are more likely to have this coverage.
