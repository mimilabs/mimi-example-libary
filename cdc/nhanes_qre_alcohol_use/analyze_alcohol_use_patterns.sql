-- Analyze Alcohol Use Patterns from NHANES Survey

/*
Business Purpose:
The NHANES QRE Alcohol Use table provides valuable insights into the alcohol consumption patterns of the U.S. population. By analyzing this data, we can gain a better understanding of the prevalence and trends of alcohol use, which can inform public health policies and interventions aimed at promoting responsible drinking and addressing alcohol-related health issues.

This query focuses on the core business value of the table by:
1. Identifying the demographic characteristics associated with different levels of alcohol consumption
2. Analyzing the frequency and quantity of alcohol use over the past 12 months
3. Examining the prevalence of binge drinking and heavy drinking behaviors

How the Query Works:

1. The query selects key columns from the `mimi_ws_1.cdc.nhanes_qre_alcohol_use` table that provide insights into the alcohol consumption patterns of survey respondents.
2. The demographic-related columns include whether the respondent has ever had at least 12 drinks in their lifetime, the frequency of alcohol consumption in the past 12 months, the average number of drinks per drinking day, and indicators of binge drinking and heavy drinking behaviors.
3. The metadata columns (mimi_src_file_date, mimi_src_file_name, mimi_dlt_load_date) are included to provide context on the data source and when the data was loaded into the table.
4. The `CASE` statement is used to convert the binary `alq11_` column into a more readable "Yes/No/Unknown" label.

Assumptions and Limitations:
- The data is based on self-reported information from survey respondents, which may be subject to recall bias or underreporting of alcohol consumption.
- The table provides a snapshot of alcohol use at the time of the survey and does not capture changes in drinking habits over time for individual respondents.
- The data may be anonymized or aggregated to protect the privacy of survey participants, which could limit the ability to perform detailed analyses at the individual level.

Possible Extensions:
- Analyze the alcohol use patterns across different demographic groups (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status) to identify high-risk populations.
- Investigate the relationship between alcohol use and other health conditions or risk factors captured in the NHANES dataset.
- Examine the trends in alcohol consumption over time across multiple NHANES survey cycles.
- Explore geographical variations in alcohol use patterns based on available location data (e.g., region, urban/rural classification).
