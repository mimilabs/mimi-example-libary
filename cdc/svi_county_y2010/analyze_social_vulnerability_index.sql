-- Analyze Social Vulnerability Index at the County Level

-- Business Purpose:
-- The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) dataset provides valuable insights into the social vulnerability of counties across the United States. This information can be used to identify areas that may require additional support or resources during emergencies, natural disasters, or public health crises. By understanding the key factors contributing to social vulnerability, policymakers and public health officials can better target interventions and allocate resources more effectively.

-- The main objectives of this query are:
-- 1. Identify the counties with the highest overall social vulnerability.
-- 2. Analyze the specific factors driving social vulnerability in these high-risk counties.
-- 3. Explore how social vulnerability varies across different states or regions.
-- 4. Assess the relationship between a county's social vulnerability and its population characteristics.

-- This analysis can help inform decision-making and strategic planning to enhance community resilience and improve outcomes for vulnerable populations.

FROM
  mimi_ws_1.cdc.svi_county_y2010
ORDER BY
  r_pl_themes DESC -- Sort by overall SVI percentile ranking in descending order
LIMIT 10; -- Show the top 10 counties with the highest social vulnerability

-- How the Query Works:
-- 1. The query selects the key columns from the `mimi_ws_1.cdc.svi_county_y2010` table, including the state, FIPS code, location, overall SVI percentile ranking, and the number of SVI factors in the 90th percentile.
-- 2. It also extracts the proportions for various social vulnerability factors, such as poverty, unemployment, lack of high school education, age, minority status, limited English proficiency, multi-unit housing, mobile homes, crowded housing, and lack of vehicle access.
-- 3. The results are ordered by the overall SVI percentile ranking in descending order, so the counties with the highest social vulnerability are displayed first.
-- 4. The `LIMIT 10` clause restricts the output to the top 10 most socially vulnerable counties.

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - The data represents a snapshot of the SVI for the year 2010 and may not reflect the most recent social vulnerability landscape.
-- - The analysis is performed at the county level, which may not capture the full granularity of social vulnerability within a county.
-- - The SVI is based on U.S. Census variables, which may not include all factors that contribute to social vulnerability.
-- - The data does not contain any personally identifiable information or specific provider names and addresses.

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Analyze how the SVI and its contributing factors have changed over time by joining this table with data from other years.
-- 2. Investigate the correlation between a county's social vulnerability and various health outcomes, such as disease prevalence or mortality rates.
-- 3. Explore the spatial distribution of social vulnerability by visualizing the data on a map, potentially identifying regional patterns or hotspots.
-- 4. Develop a predictive model to identify counties that may require additional resources or support during public health emergencies or natural disasters based on their SVI and other relevant factors.
