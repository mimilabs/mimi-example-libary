/* NHANES Metadata Analysis - Survey Coverage and Variable Distribution
 *
 * Business Purpose:
 * This query analyzes the NHANES metadata to understand:
 * - Survey coverage across years
 * - Distribution of variables across components
 * - Key data files and their contents
 * 
 * This helps researchers and analysts:
 * 1. Plan their studies by identifying available data periods
 * 2. Locate relevant variables and files for their research
 * 3. Understand the scope of NHANES components

/* How This Query Works:
 * 1. Creates a CTE to aggregate metadata by component
 * 2. Calculates key metrics: date ranges, variable counts, file counts
 * 3. Computes percentage distribution of variables across components
 * 4. Orders results by variable count to highlight richest data areas
 *
 * Assumptions & Limitations:
 * - Assumes component field is meaningful for categorization
 * - Does not account for variable overlap between components
 * - Treats all variables as equally important
 * - Does not consider data quality or completeness
 *
 * Possible Extensions:
 * 1. Add filtering by specific years or components
 * 2. Include analysis of use_constraints
 * 3. Add variable name pattern analysis
 * 4. Cross-reference with actual data availability
 * 5. Add trend analysis of variable counts over time

    - Additional Notes: Query summarizes NHANES survey data coverage and variable distribution across components but relies on non-null component values. Consider additional data quality checks before using results for research planning. The variable percentages provide relative scope but may not reflect actual data availability or research utility.
