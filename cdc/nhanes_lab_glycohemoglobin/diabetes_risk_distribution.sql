Title: Diabetes Risk Assessment Based on Glycohemoglobin Levels
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from the CDC NHANES survey data
to assess diabetes risk in the surveyed population. It calculates key statistics
and risk categories that healthcare professionals and policymakers can use for:
- Population health assessment
- Diabetes screening program planning
- Public health intervention targeting

    CASE 
      WHEN lbxgh < 5.7 THEN 'Normal'
      WHEN lbxgh >= 5.7 AND lbxgh < 6.5 THEN 'Prediabetes'
      WHEN lbxgh >= 6.5 THEN 'Diabetes'
      ELSE 'Unknown'

/*******************************************************************************
How This Query Works:
1. Creates categories based on clinical thresholds for diabetes risk
2. Calculates distribution statistics across categories
3. Provides summary metrics within each category

Key Assumptions & Limitations:
- Uses standard clinical thresholds (5.7% for prediabetes, 6.5% for diabetes)
- Assumes data quality and accurate measurements
- Does not account for demographic factors or other health conditions
- Point-in-time measurement may not reflect long-term status

Possible Extensions:
1. Add trend analysis across survey years:
   - Add GROUP BY YEAR(mimi_src_file_date)
   
2. Include demographic analysis:
   - Join with demographics table to analyze by age, gender, etc.
   
3. Add detailed percentile calculations:
   - Include PERCENTILE_CONT calculations for more granular distribution analysis
   
4. Geographic analysis:
   - Join with location data to identify regional patterns
   
5. Risk progression analysis:
   - For subjects with multiple measurements, track changes over time

    - Additional Notes: This query focuses on population-level diabetes risk assessment through glycohemoglobin analysis. Results are most meaningful when the sample size is large enough to be representative of the target population. The categorization thresholds (5.7% and 6.5%) are based on standard clinical guidelines but may need adjustment based on specific research or clinical requirements.
