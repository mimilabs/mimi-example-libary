-- Glycohemoglobin Data Quality and Completeness Analysis
--
-- Business Purpose:
-- This query assesses the quality and completeness of glycohemoglobin measurements
-- across different data collection periods to ensure reliable analytics and identify
-- potential data collection or reporting issues that could impact population health studies.

WITH sample_metrics AS (
  -- Calculate key quality metrics per data collection period
  SELECT 
    YEAR(mimi_src_file_date) as collection_year,
    COUNT(*) as total_samples,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN lbxgh IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as valid_measurements,
    MIN(lbxgh) as min_glyco,
    MAX(lbxgh) as max_glyco,
    AVG(lbxgh) as avg_glyco,
    STDDEV(lbxgh) as std_glyco
  FROM mimi_ws_1.cdc.nhanes_lab_glycohemoglobin
  GROUP BY YEAR(mimi_src_file_date)
)

SELECT
  collection_year,
  total_samples,
  valid_measurements,
  ROUND(100.0 * valid_measurements / total_samples, 1) as completion_rate,
  ROUND(min_glyco, 1) as min_glyco,
  ROUND(max_glyco, 1) as max_glyco,
  ROUND(avg_glyco, 1) as avg_glyco,
  ROUND(std_glyco, 1) as std_glyco,
  -- Flag potentially problematic data periods
  CASE 
    WHEN valid_measurements < 1000 THEN 'Low Sample Size'
    WHEN max_glyco > 20 THEN 'Extreme High Values'
    WHEN std_glyco > 3 THEN 'High Variability'
    ELSE 'Normal'
  END as quality_flag
FROM sample_metrics
ORDER BY collection_year DESC;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Groups data by collection year from the source file date
-- 2. Calculates sample sizes and completion rates
-- 3. Computes basic statistical measures for glycohemoglobin values
-- 4. Flags potential data quality issues based on predefined thresholds
--
-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Uses mimi_src_file_date as a proxy for data collection period
-- - Assumes glycohemoglobin values > 20 are potentially erroneous
-- - Considers sample sizes < 1000 as potentially insufficient
-- - Standard deviation > 3 might indicate inconsistent measurement methods
--
-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add seasonal analysis within years to identify collection patterns
-- 2. Compare data quality metrics across different source file names
-- 3. Implement more sophisticated outlier detection methods
-- 4. Add trending analysis to detect gradual quality deterioration
-- 5. Cross-validate with other NHANES lab measurements for consistency
