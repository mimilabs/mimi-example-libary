-- Parental Origin Impact on Healthcare Cultural Competency

/*
Business Purpose:
This analysis examines the relationship between parents' country of birth and language
preferences to help healthcare organizations:
1. Design culturally appropriate patient education materials
2. Allocate translation services efficiently
3. Identify potential cultural barriers to healthcare access
4. Support population health management strategies

The insights can guide resource allocation for multilingual services and cultural
competency training programs.

/*
HOW IT WORKS:
1. Creates a CTE to categorize respondents based on their parents' birth country
2. Combines this with language preference data
3. Calculates distribution of language preferences within each parent origin category
4. Presents results as counts and percentages

ASSUMPTIONS & LIMITATIONS:
- Assumes missing data is random and not systematic
- Limited to available language categories in the survey
- Does not account for temporal changes in language usage
- May not capture full complexity of multilingual households

POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS:
1. Add temporal analysis to track changes over survey years
2. Include cross-analysis with health outcomes
3. Segment by specific countries of origin for targeted interventions
4. Incorporate analysis of language used with healthcare providers
5. Add geographic analysis for regional service planning

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on demographic segmentation based on parental origin and provides percentage distributions of language preferences within each segment. Best used for healthcare resource planning and cultural competency program development. Note that the analysis requires non-null values for both parent birth country fields (acd070, acd080) which may exclude some respondents.
