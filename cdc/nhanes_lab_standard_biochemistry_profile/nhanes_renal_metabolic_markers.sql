-- NHANES Renal Function and Metabolic Risk Assessment
-- Business Purpose:
-- - Evaluate population-level kidney function and metabolic health markers
-- - Identify potential undiagnosed renal dysfunction through biomarker patterns
-- - Support population health strategies for early intervention in kidney disease
-- - Aid in understanding metabolic syndrome prevalence through combined markers

/*
How this query works:
- Calculates population-level averages for key renal and metabolic markers
- Applies basic data quality filters to remove invalid values
- Provides counts of patients with elevated risk markers
- Includes temporal range of source data

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Uses basic threshold values that may need clinical validation
- Does not account for age/gender differences in normal ranges
- Missing values are excluded from averages
- Does not consider medication effects or comorbidities

Possible Extensions:
1. Add age/gender stratification for more precise risk assessment
2. Include eGFR calculation using MDRD or CKD-EPI formulas
3. Add trending analysis across multiple time periods
4. Incorporate BMI/blood pressure data for metabolic syndrome analysis
5. Add reference ranges and percent outside normal limits

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on population-level renal and metabolic health assessment using NHANES biomarkers. The thresholds used (creatinine >1.3, glucose >100) are simplified reference points and should be validated against clinical guidelines before use in research. Data quality filters may need adjustment based on specific research requirements.
