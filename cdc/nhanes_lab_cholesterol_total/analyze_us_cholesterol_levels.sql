-- Analyzing Total Cholesterol Levels in the U.S. Population

/*
 * Business Purpose:
 * The `nhanes_lab_cholesterol_total` table provides valuable insights into the distribution of total cholesterol levels in the U.S. population. This information is crucial for understanding the prevalence of high cholesterol, a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and can inform public health policies and interventions targeted at improving the population's overall cardiovascular health.

  seqn AS respondent_id,

  mimi_src_file_date AS data_publication_date,
  mimi_src_file_name AS source_file

  -- Filter out any missing or invalid total cholesterol values
  lbxtc IS NOT NULL AND lbdtcsi IS NOT NULL

/*
 * How the query works:
 * 1. The query selects the relevant columns from the `nhanes_lab_cholesterol_total` table, including the respondent ID, total cholesterol values in mg/dL and mmol/L, and metadata about the source file.
 * 2. The WHERE clause filters out any rows with missing or invalid total cholesterol values, ensuring the analysis is based on complete and reliable data.
 * 3. The results are ordered by total cholesterol in ascending order, which will help in understanding the distribution of cholesterol levels in the population.
 *
 * Assumptions and limitations:
 * - The data represents a snapshot of the NHANES survey and may not reflect the most current cholesterol levels in the U.S. population.
 * - The data is anonymized and does not contain any demographic or socioeconomic information, limiting the ability to study disparities in cholesterol levels across different population subgroups.
 *
 * Possible extensions:
 * 1. Analyze the distribution of total cholesterol levels, including calculating summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) and visualizing the data using histograms or box plots.
 * 2. Investigate temporal trends in total cholesterol levels by grouping the data by the data publication date and analyzing changes over time.
 * 3. Correlate total cholesterol levels with other risk factors, such as obesity, physical activity, and dietary habits, to identify potential drivers of high cholesterol in the population.
 * 4. Estimate the proportion of the U.S. population with high total cholesterol levels (â‰¥ 240 mg/dL) and identify any demographic or socioeconomic factors associated with increased risk.
