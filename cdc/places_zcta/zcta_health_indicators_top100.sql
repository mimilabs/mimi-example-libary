Title: PLACES Health Measures Analysis by ZCTA - Core Health Indicators
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes key health indicators across ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)
to identify areas with significant health challenges. It focuses on major chronic 
conditions and health behaviors that have substantial public health impact.

The analysis helps:
- Target public health interventions to high-need areas
- Identify geographic disparities in health outcomes
- Support resource allocation and program planning
*******************************************************************************/

-- Select key health measures and their prevalence by ZCTA
SELECT
    location_name as zcta,
    total_population,
    -- Get latest values for major health indicators
    MAX(CASE WHEN measure_id = 'DIABETES' THEN data_value END) as diabetes_prev,
    MAX(CASE WHEN measure_id = 'OBESITY' THEN data_value END) as obesity_prev,
    MAX(CASE WHEN measure_id = 'MHLTH' THEN data_value END) as mental_health_prev,
    MAX(CASE WHEN measure_id = 'CSMOKING' THEN data_value END) as smoking_prev,
    MAX(CASE WHEN measure_id = 'PHLTH' THEN data_value END) as poor_health_prev
FROM mimi_ws_1.cdc.places_zcta
WHERE 
    -- Get most recent year
    year = (SELECT MAX(year) FROM mimi_ws_1.cdc.places_zcta)
    -- Focus on age-adjusted prevalence measures
    AND data_value_type = 'Age-adjusted prevalence'
    -- Include only ZCTAs with complete data
    AND data_value IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    location_name,
    total_population
-- Order by population to highlight impact
ORDER BY total_population DESC
LIMIT 100;

/*******************************************************************************
How it works:
1. Selects the most recent year's data
2. Pivots key health measures into columns using conditional aggregation
3. Filters for age-adjusted prevalence to ensure comparability
4. Groups by ZCTA to get one row per geographic area
5. Orders by population to highlight areas with greatest impact

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Uses age-adjusted rates to control for demographic differences
- Limited to ZCTAs with complete data for all measures
- Does not account for confidence intervals
- Top 100 most populous ZCTAs only

Possible Extensions:
1. Add confidence interval analysis for statistical significance
2. Include trend analysis by comparing multiple years
3. Add demographic factors from additional data sources
4. Create geographic clusters of high-risk areas
5. Incorporate preventive services measures for correlation analysis

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on the top 100 most populous ZCTAs and their key health indicators (diabetes, obesity, mental health, smoking, and poor health). Note that it only includes age-adjusted prevalence rates, which may exclude some ZCTAs with incomplete data. The results represent the most recent year's data only and do not include statistical significance testing.
