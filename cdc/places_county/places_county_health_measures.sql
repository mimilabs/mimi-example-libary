-- PLACES: Exploring County-Level Health Measures

/*
This SQL query demonstrates the core business value of the PLACES (Local Data for Better Health) dataset, which provides a comprehensive set of health-related measures at the county level across the United States.

The key business value of this dataset is to enable public health professionals, policymakers, and researchers to:
1. Identify emerging health problems and disparities across different counties and states.
2. Develop and implement targeted public health prevention activities based on the local health data.
3. Understand the relationships between various health outcomes, preventive services use, and risk behaviors at the county level.
4. Inform decision-making and resource allocation for improving the overall health and well-being of local communities.

/*
This query retrieves the most recent year's data from the PLACES_county table and selects the following key columns:
- state_desc: The name of the state
- location_name: The name of the county
- measure: The health-related measure (e.g., obesity prevalence, cancer screening rates)
- data_value: The estimated value for the measure
- data_value_unit: The unit of the data value (e.g., percentage, rate)
- data_value_type: The type of the data value (e.g., age-adjusted prevalence, crude prevalence)
- low_confidence_limit: The lower bound of the confidence interval
- high_confidence_limit: The upper bound of the confidence interval

The results are ordered by state, county, and measure to provide a structured view of the data.

The query works by:
1. Identifying the most recent year of data available in the table.
2. Selecting the relevant columns for the analysis.
3. Ordering the results to facilitate easy exploration and comparison of the data.

Assumptions and Limitations:
- The query assumes that the most recent year of data is the most relevant for the analysis.
- The query does not include any filters or aggregations, as the focus is on demonstrating the core business value of the dataset.

Possible Extensions:
1. Analyze the variation in health measures across different counties within a state or across different states.
2. Investigate the relationships between preventive services use and health outcomes at the county level.
3. Explore the differences in chronic disease-related risk behaviors between urban and rural counties.
4. Analyze the associations between the prevalence of disabilities and socioeconomic factors at the county level.
5. Examine how the prevalence of certain health measures has changed over time in specific counties or states.
