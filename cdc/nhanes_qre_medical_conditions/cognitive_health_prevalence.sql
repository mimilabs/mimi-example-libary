-- NHANES Mental Health and Cognitive Function Analysis
-- Business Purpose: 
-- - Examine prevalence of cognitive impairment and memory issues in population
-- - Analyze correlation between self-reported memory problems and daily functioning
-- - Identify demographic patterns in cognitive health outcomes
-- - Support population health management and early intervention programs

SELECT 
    -- Memory and cognitive indicators
    COUNT(*) as total_respondents,
    
    -- Overall prevalence of memory issues
    SUM(CASE WHEN mcq084 = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as reported_memory_decline,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN mcq084 = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) as pct_memory_decline,

FROM mimi_ws_1.cdc.nhanes_qre_medical_conditions
WHERE mcq084 IS NOT NULL  -- Focus on valid responses

-- Query Operation:
-- 1. Counts total respondents with valid cognitive assessment data
-- 2. Calculates prevalence of self-reported memory decline
-- 3. Breaks down frequency of memory impacts on daily activities
-- 4. Identifies relevant co-occurring conditions
-- 5. Includes family history and treatment compliance metrics

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Relies on self-reported data which may have recall bias
-- - Memory decline questions were only asked in certain survey years
-- - Does not account for severity of cognitive impairment
-- - Family history may be underreported

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add demographic breakdowns (age groups, gender, education level)
-- 2. Include temporal trends across survey years
-- 3. Analyze correlation with medications and treatments
-- 4. Incorporate lifestyle factors (exercise, diet, social engagement)
-- 5. Compare cognitive health metrics across different medical conditions
-- 6. Add geographic analysis if location data available

    - Additional Notes: The query analyzes NHANES mental health indicators with focus on memory decline and cognitive function. Primary metrics include self-reported memory issues, daily impact patterns, and correlation with other health conditions. The analysis provides baseline data for population health management but should be interpreted alongside clinical assessments due to self-reporting limitations.
