Title: Basic Analysis of Population Insulin Levels from NHANES Survey Data
  
Business Purpose:
- Analyze the distribution of insulin levels in the US population
- Provide baseline statistics for understanding metabolic health
- Support research into diabetes risk factors and public health planning
*******************************************************************************/

/*******************************************************************************
How this query works:
1. Filters out invalid/null insulin measurements
2. Calculates basic statistical measures for insulin levels
3. Determines distribution percentiles
4. Includes average fasting time for context

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Assumes insulin measurements > 0 are valid
- Does not account for demographic factors
- Does not consider survey weights
- Single point-in-time measurements only

Possible Extensions:
1. Add demographic breakdowns (would need to join with demographics table)
2. Incorporate survey weights for population-level estimates
3. Analyze trends over time using mimi_src_file_date
4. Add BMI correlation analysis
5. Compare insulin levels across different fasting durations
6. Add confidence intervals for the estimates

    - Additional Notes: The query uses basic statistical calculations suitable for initial population health analysis. Note that the results will be more accurate when combined with NHANES survey weights (wtsafprp) for population-level estimates. Fasting time calculations assume both hours and minutes fields are populated correctly.
