NHANES Kidney Health Risk Assessment Analysis

Business Purpose:
This query analyzes urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) from NHANES data to assess 
population-level kidney health risks. High ACR values (>30 mg/g) indicate potential kidney 
dysfunction, making this a vital public health screening metric.

How the Query Works:
1. Creates a CTE to categorize participants based on their ACR values
2. Calculates distribution statistics for each risk category
3. Presents results with counts, percentages, and ACR statistics

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Uses only first ACR measurement (urdact) rather than second measurement (urdact2)
- Risk categories based on standard clinical thresholds but may need adjustment
- Null values are excluded from analysis
- Does not account for demographic or other health factors

Possible Extensions:
1. Add demographic analysis by joining with NHANES demographic tables
2. Include temporal trends by analyzing mimi_src_file_date
3. Compare first and second measurements (urdact vs urdact2)
4. Add additional risk factors such as diabetes or hypertension
5. Create visualizations of distribution patterns
6. Add statistical significance tests between groups

    - Additional Notes: Query provides population-level kidney health risk assessment using NHANES ACR data. Best used for initial health risk screening and epidemiological research. Note that the risk categories (Normal < 30, Moderately High 30-299, High >= 300 mg/g) are based on standard clinical thresholds but may need adjustment for specific research purposes.
