-- Title: Mental Health and Economic Impact Analysis by Census Tract 

-- Business Purpose:
-- This query analyzes mental health prevalence patterns across census tracts
-- and identifies areas where mental health challenges may be creating economic burden.
-- The insights can help target mental health resources and support services
-- to communities with the highest need.

WITH mental_health_data AS (
  -- Get mental health prevalence data by census tract
  SELECT 
    state_desc,
    county_name,
    locationid AS tract_id,
    data_value AS mental_health_prevalence,
    total_population,
    total_pop18plus
  FROM mimi_ws_1.cdc.places_censustract
  WHERE year = 2021
    AND measure_id = 'DEPRESSION'
    AND data_value IS NOT NULL
),

tract_summary AS (
  -- Calculate key metrics and ranks
  SELECT
    state_desc,
    county_name,
    tract_id,
    mental_health_prevalence,
    total_population,
    total_pop18plus,
    -- Calculate estimated affected population
    ROUND(mental_health_prevalence * total_pop18plus / 100, 0) AS estimated_affected_adults,
    -- Calculate state-level ranks
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY state_desc ORDER BY mental_health_prevalence DESC) AS state_rank
  FROM mental_health_data
)

-- Generate final analysis output
SELECT 
  state_desc,
  county_name,
  tract_id,
  mental_health_prevalence AS depression_prevalence_pct,
  total_population,
  total_pop18plus AS adult_population,
  estimated_affected_adults,
  state_rank AS severity_rank_in_state,
  -- Calculate estimated annual economic impact assuming $1000 per affected person
  estimated_affected_adults * 1000 AS estimated_annual_impact_dollars
FROM tract_summary
WHERE state_rank <= 10  -- Focus on top 10 most affected tracts per state
ORDER BY state_desc, state_rank;

-- How the Query Works:
-- 1. First CTE gets base mental health prevalence data
-- 2. Second CTE calculates key derived metrics and rankings
-- 3. Final SELECT formats and presents the analysis with economic impact estimation
-- 4. Results are filtered to top 10 tracts per state by severity

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Uses depression as proxy for mental health burden
-- - Economic impact calculation uses simplified $1000/person assumption
-- - Analysis limited to most recent year (2021)
-- - Requires valid data_value entries (NULL values excluded)

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add trend analysis by comparing multiple years
-- 2. Include additional mental health measures beyond depression
-- 3. Correlate with other socioeconomic indicators
-- 4. Add geographical clustering analysis
-- 5. Compare urban vs rural tract patterns
-- 6. Include confidence interval analysis using low_confidence_limit and high_confidence_limit
-- 7. Add demographic breakdowns where available

    - Additional Notes: Query assumes $1000 per person economic impact which should be adjusted based on local economic conditions and more detailed impact studies. Results are most meaningful when analyzed alongside local mental health service availability data.
