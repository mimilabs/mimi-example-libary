-- Air Quality Analysis for Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs)

/*
This SQL query demonstrates the core business value of the `mimi_ws_1.epa.airdata_daily_cbsa` table, which provides daily Air Quality Index (AQI) data for Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) in the United States. The data can be used to analyze air quality trends, compare air quality across different CBSAs, and assess the health impacts of air pollution.

The main use cases for this data include:
1. Monitoring air quality trends over time within a CBSA
2. Comparing air quality across different CBSAs to identify areas with poor air quality
3. Assessing the potential health impacts of air pollution in specific CBSAs
4. Evaluating the effectiveness of air quality management policies and regulations
5. Informing public health decisions and emergency response planning

/*
This query retrieves the key information from the `mimi_ws_1.epa.airdata_daily_cbsa` table, including the CBSA name and code, the date of the air quality measurement, the AQI value, the AQI category, the pollutant that determined the AQI, the monitoring site that reported the highest AQI, the number of sites reporting, and the source file information.

The `WHERE` clause filters the data to include only the past year, as recent air quality data is typically more relevant for analysis and decision-making.

The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the data first by CBSA and then by date in descending order, so that the most recent data for each CBSA is displayed first.

Assumptions and Limitations:
- The data is aggregated at the CBSA level, so it may not capture local variations in air quality within each CBSA.
- The data does not provide information on the specific pollutants contributing to the AQI value for each day.
- The data is a snapshot and may not reflect the most recent air quality measurements.
- The data does not include demographic information about the populations affected by air pollution in each CBSA.

Possible Extensions:
1. Calculate summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for the AQI values by CBSA and time period to identify trends and outliers.
2. Visualize the AQI data using charts or maps to better understand the spatial and temporal patterns of air quality.
3. Combine the AQI data with other relevant datasets (e.g., weather data, economic indicators, population demographics) to explore the factors that influence air quality in different CBSAs.
4. Develop predictive models to forecast air quality based on historical data and external factors, which could inform public health decisions and emergency response planning.
5. Analyze the relationship between air quality and health outcomes (e.g., respiratory diseases, hospital admissions) to quantify the public health impacts of air pollution.
