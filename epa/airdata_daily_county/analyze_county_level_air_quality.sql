-- Analyze County-Level Air Quality Index (AQI) Trends

-- This query analyzes the county-level air quality data from the `mimi_ws_1.epa.airdata_daily_county` table to provide insights into air quality trends across the United States.

-- The key business value of this data is to understand the current state of air quality at the county level, identify geographic and temporal patterns, and potentially use this information to inform policy decisions, public health initiatives, or environmental research.

-- Main Query
SELECT
  state_name,
  county_name,
  date,
  aqi,
  category,
  defining_parameter
FROM mimi_ws_1.epa.airdata_daily_county
ORDER BY state_name, county_name, date;

-- The query retrieves the state name, county name, date, AQI value, AQI category, and the pollutant responsible for the AQI (defining parameter) from the table.
-- This provides a holistic view of the air quality conditions across different counties and over time.

-- The results can be used to:
-- 1. Identify counties or regions with consistently poor air quality, which could inform targeted interventions or further investigation.
-- 2. Analyze seasonal patterns in air quality, which may be influenced by factors like weather, industrial activity, or transportation.
-- 3. Correlate the defining parameter with potential sources of pollution, such as industrial facilities, vehicle emissions, or agricultural practices.
-- 4. Investigate the relationship between air quality and population demographics or socioeconomic factors to uncover potential environmental justice issues.

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- 1. The data provides a high-level, county-level view of air quality and may not capture localized variations within counties.
-- 2. The data does not include real-time or near-real-time measurements, so it may not reflect the most current air quality conditions.
-- 3. The data does not provide information on the specific monitoring stations or their locations, which could be useful for understanding the representativeness of the measurements.

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Incorporate additional data sources, such as population, economic, or land use data, to analyze the relationship between air quality and other socioeconomic or environmental factors.
-- 2. Develop more advanced analytics, such as time series forecasting or spatial analysis, to predict air quality trends or identify high-risk areas.
-- 3. Integrate the air quality data with health data to investigate the potential impacts of air pollution on public health outcomes.
-- 4. Automate the analysis and reporting process to provide regular updates on air quality conditions to stakeholders, such as policymakers or public health officials.
