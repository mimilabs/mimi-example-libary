Title: MAC Locality Distribution Analysis
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes the distribution of Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) 
localities across states to understand Medicare's administrative coverage and 
potential service delivery patterns.

The insights help:
- Assess geographic distribution of Medicare administration
- Identify states with complex MAC locality structures
- Support planning for Medicare service delivery optimization

    -- Calculate locality counts per state

        MAX(num_localities) as max_localities,
        MIN(num_localities) as min_localities
    FROM locality_counts

-- Final output combining state details with overall statistics
SELECT 
    lc.state_name,
    lc.state_abbr,
    lc.num_localities,
    lc.num_macs,
    ROUND(lc.num_localities * 100.0 / 
        (SELECT SUM(num_localities) FROM locality_counts), 2) as pct_of_total_localities,
    ss.avg_localities_per_state as national_avg_localities

ORDER BY lc.num_localities DESC;

/*******************************************************************************
How It Works:
1. First CTE (locality_counts) aggregates locality and MAC counts by state
2. Second CTE (state_stats) calculates national-level statistics
3. Main query combines the data and filters for states with above-average localities

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes current data represents active MAC localities
- Does not account for population or geographic size differences
- Limited to structural analysis without payment or service data

Possible Extensions:
1. Add temporal analysis by incorporating mimi_src_file_date
2. Join with payment data to analyze spending patterns by locality
3. Include population data to calculate per-capita metrics
4. Add geographic clustering analysis for MAC distribution patterns
5. Incorporate year-over-year changes in MAC assignments

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on state-level MAC locality distribution patterns and may require additional memory for large datasets. Results are most meaningful when analyzing recent data periods, as MAC assignments can change over time. Consider adding WHERE clause with specific mimi_src_file_date for point-in-time analysis.
