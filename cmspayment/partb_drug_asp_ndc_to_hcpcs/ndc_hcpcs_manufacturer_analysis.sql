Title: NDC to HCPCS Drug Mapping Analysis
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes the mapping between National Drug Codes (NDCs) and HCPCS codes
to provide insights into drug pricing and billing standardization. It helps:
- Understand drug billing code distributions across manufacturers
- Identify billing unit standardization patterns
- Support cost analysis and reimbursement planning
*******************************************************************************/

-- Get summary metrics for each HCPCS code and manufacturer
WITH hcpcs_metrics AS (
  SELECT 
    hcpcs_code,
    short_descriptor,
    labeler_name,
    -- Count distinct NDCs per HCPCS-manufacturer combination
    COUNT(DISTINCT ndc) as ndc_count,
    -- Get average billing units per package
    AVG(billunitspkg) as avg_bill_units,
    -- Get latest data date
    MAX(mimi_src_file_date) as latest_date
  FROM mimi_ws_1.cmspayment.partb_drug_asp_ndc_to_hcpcs
  GROUP BY 1,2,3
),

-- Aggregate metrics at HCPCS level
hcpcs_summary AS (
  SELECT
    hcpcs_code,
    short_descriptor,
    COUNT(DISTINCT labeler_name) as manufacturer_count,
    SUM(ndc_count) as total_ndcs,
    AVG(avg_bill_units) as avg_billing_units_per_pkg,
    MAX(latest_date) as latest_date
  FROM hcpcs_metrics
  GROUP BY 1,2
  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT labeler_name) > 1
),

-- Get top manufacturer for each HCPCS code
top_manufacturers AS (
  SELECT 
    hcpcs_code,
    FIRST_VALUE(labeler_name) OVER (
      PARTITION BY hcpcs_code 
      ORDER BY ndc_count DESC
      ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as top_manufacturer
  FROM hcpcs_metrics
)

-- Combine all metrics
SELECT 
  s.*,
  t.top_manufacturer
FROM hcpcs_summary s
JOIN top_manufacturers t ON s.hcpcs_code = t.hcpcs_code
ORDER BY s.total_ndcs DESC
LIMIT 20;

/*******************************************************************************
How this query works:
1. Creates metrics per HCPCS-manufacturer combination
2. Aggregates to HCPCS level to analyze manufacturer and NDC distributions
3. Identifies top manufacturer for each HCPCS code
4. Combines metrics and filters for drugs with multiple manufacturers
5. Orders by total NDC count to highlight most variable drugs

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes current NDC-HCPCS mappings are valid
- Does not account for historical changes in mappings
- Does not consider drug pricing information
- Limited to top 20 results for readability

Possible Extensions:
1. Add trend analysis by comparing metrics across mimi_src_file_dates
2. Include package size analysis to identify dosing variations
3. Compare billing unit standardization across therapeutic categories
4. Add filters for specific drug classes or manufacturers
5. Expand to analyze generic vs brand name patterns

    - Additional Notes: This query provides insights into drug manufacturer diversity and NDC distributions across HCPCS codes. Results are limited to drugs with multiple manufacturers and top 20 by NDC count. Performance may be impacted for large datasets due to window functions and multiple joins. Consider adding date filters if analyzing specific time periods.
