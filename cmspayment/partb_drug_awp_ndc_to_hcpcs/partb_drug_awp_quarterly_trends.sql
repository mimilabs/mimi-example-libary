-- Title: Part B Drug AWP Pricing Changes Over Time Analysis

-- Business Purpose:
-- - Track average wholesale price (AWP) trends across quarters for Part B drugs
-- - Identify high volume drugs with significant price variations 
-- - Enable prioritization of drug cost management initiatives
-- - Support negotiations and contracting strategies

WITH quarterly_data AS (
  -- Get the year-quarter from the file date

SELECT

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Creates quarterly snapshots of drug packaging data
-- 2. Aggregates key metrics by drug and quarter
-- 3. Calculates quarter-over-quarter changes in package quantities
-- 4. Orders results to highlight drugs with most package variations

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Uses file date as proxy for pricing effective date
-- - Limited to last 24 months of data
-- - Focuses on package quantity changes rather than direct price changes
-- - Assumes package variations indicate pricing complexity

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add filters for specific therapeutic classes
-- 2. Include statistical analysis of price variation
-- 3. Add manufacturer market share analysis
-- 4. Compare brand vs generic packaging strategies
-- 5. Add geographic distribution analysis

    - Additional Notes: Query tracks package quantity changes as a proxy for pricing variations across quarters. While the table name suggests AWP data, the current implementation focuses on package metrics since direct AWP values aren't available in the column list. Consider enhancing with actual pricing data if available through related tables.
