Title: Medicare Part B Drug Code and Package Analysis
 
Business Purpose:
- Analyze the relationship between HCPCS codes and NDCs for Part B drugs
- Understand drug packaging and billing units across manufacturers
- Track changes in drug codes and descriptions over time
- Support Medicare Part B drug pricing and reimbursement analysis

-- Main query examining drug code mapping and package characteristics
WITH latest_data AS (
  SELECT 
    -- Get most recent file date to ensure current data
    MAX(mimi_src_file_date) as max_file_date
  FROM mimi_ws_1.cmspayment.partb_drug_awp_ndc_to_hcpcs
)

SELECT
  hcpcs_code,
  short_descriptor,
  labeler_name,
  drug_name,
  -- Calculate metrics around packaging
  COUNT(DISTINCT ndc) as ndc_count,
  AVG(pkg_qty) as avg_pkg_qty,
  AVG(billunits) as avg_bill_units,
  -- Include file date for tracking
  mimi_src_file_date

FROM mimi_ws_1.cmspayment.partb_drug_awp_ndc_to_hcpcs p
JOIN latest_data l
  ON p.mimi_src_file_date = l.max_file_date

GROUP BY 
  hcpcs_code,
  short_descriptor,

-- Focus on entries with complete data
HAVING ndc_count > 0

ORDER BY ndc_count DESC
LIMIT 100;

/*************************************************************************
How This Query Works:
1. Gets the most recent file date to ensure current analysis
2. Aggregates drug packaging metrics by HCPCS code and manufacturer
3. Calculates average package quantities and billing units
4. Returns top 100 drug codes by NDC count

Key Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes the latest file date represents most current data
- Limited to drugs with valid NDC mappings
- Aggregates at HCPCS/manufacturer level only
- Does not include pricing information

Possible Extensions:
1. Add price trend analysis over multiple file dates
2. Compare package sizes across manufacturers for same HCPCS
3. Analyze billing unit variations by drug class
4. Include geographic usage patterns
5. Add therapeutic classification groupings

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on latest available data snapshot and basic package metrics. Consider adding WHERE clauses for specific drug classes or date ranges if analyzing historical trends. Performance may be impacted with large date ranges due to the MAX() aggregation in the CTE.
