-- Exploring Drug Utilization and Reimbursement Patterns Using the OPPS NDC-HCPCS Crosswalk

/*
Business Purpose:
The OPPS NDC-HCPCS Crosswalk table provides a mapping between National Drug Codes (NDCs) and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes for drugs and biologicals covered under the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS). This data can be used to analyze drug utilization and reimbursement patterns, which is valuable for healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers.

The following query demonstrates how to extract insights from this table, focusing on the most common HCPCS codes and their associated drug information.

SELECT
  hcpcs_code,
  short_descriptor,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ndc) AS unique_ndcs,
  COUNT(*) AS total_records,
  MIN(billunits) AS min_billunits,
  MAX(billunits) AS max_billunits,
  AVG(billunits) AS avg_billunits
FROM mimi_ws_1.cmspayment.partb_drug_opps_ndc_to_hcpcs
GROUP BY hcpcs_code, short_descriptor
ORDER BY total_records DESC
LIMIT 10;

/*
How the Query Works:

1. The query selects the following columns from the table:
   - `hcpcs_code`: The Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code for the drug
   - `short_descriptor`: A brief description of the HCPCS code
   - `COUNT(DISTINCT ndc)`: The number of unique National Drug Codes (NDCs) associated with each HCPCS code
   - `COUNT(*)`: The total number of records for each HCPCS code
   - `MIN(billunits)`, `MAX(billunits)`, and `AVG(billunits)`: The minimum, maximum, and average billing units for each HCPCS code

2. The data is grouped by the `hcpcs_code` and `short_descriptor` columns.
3. The results are ordered by the `total_records` column in descending order.
4. The top 10 rows are returned, providing insights into the most commonly used HCPCS codes and their associated drug information.

Assumptions and Limitations:
- The data in the OPPS NDC-HCPCS Crosswalk table is a snapshot at a specific point in time and may not reflect the most current information.
- The table does not provide any information on the actual utilization or reimbursement amounts associated with the drugs and HCPCS codes.
- The data does not contain any provider-specific information, as it is focused on the drug-to-code mapping.

Possible Extensions:
1. Analyze the relationships between NDCs and HCPCS codes over time to identify any changes or trends.
2. Investigate the distribution of drug manufacturers across different therapeutic areas or HCPCS code groups.
3. Explore the potential gaps in drug coverage or inconsistencies in coding practices by identifying HCPCS codes with a limited number of associated NDCs.
4. Combine the OPPS NDC-HCPCS Crosswalk data with other data sources, such as drug pricing or utilization data, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the healthcare landscape.
