-- Medicare Part B Drug Generic Name Analysis
-- Business Purpose:
-- - Analyze distribution of generic drugs across multiple manufacturers
-- - Identify potential generic drug competition opportunities
-- - Support drug pricing negotiation and cost management strategies
-- - Track generic drug market dynamics over time

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Creates a summary of generic drugs showing manufacturer count and related metrics
-- 2. Analyzes the temporal presence of generic drugs in the dataset
-- 3. Combines the information to provide a comprehensive view of generic drug market dynamics
-- 4. Classifies competition levels based on manufacturer count

-- Assumptions and limitations:
-- - Assumes drug_generic_name is consistently formatted across records
-- - Does not account for manufacturer market share or volume
-- - Limited to drugs present in Medicare Part B
-- - Time analysis based on source file dates may not reflect actual market entry/exit

-- Possible extensions:
-- 1. Add volume or pricing data to assess market concentration
-- 2. Include therapeutic class analysis for market segment insights
-- 3. Track changes in manufacturer count over time
-- 4. Add filters for specific therapeutic areas or time periods
-- 5. Include analysis of dosage forms and strengths by manufacturer

    - Additional Notes: The query provides market competition analysis for generic drugs in Medicare Part B by tracking manufacturer counts, NDC variations, and temporal presence. Uses COLLECT_LIST and ARRAY_JOIN functions specific to Databricks SQL. Results help identify opportunities for cost optimization and market competition assessment.
