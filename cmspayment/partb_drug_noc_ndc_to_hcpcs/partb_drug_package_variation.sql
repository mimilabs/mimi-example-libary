-- Medicare Part B Drug Package Size Analysis
-- Business Purpose:
-- - Analyze drug package sizes and billing units across manufacturers
-- - Identify opportunities for standardization and cost efficiency
-- - Support formulary management and purchasing decisions
-- - Enable comparison of similar drugs across different manufacturers

WITH pkg_metrics AS (
  -- Calculate metrics by generic drug name and dosage
  SELECT 
    drug_generic_name,
    dosage,
    COUNT(DISTINCT pkg_size) as unique_pkg_sizes,
    COUNT(DISTINCT labeler_name) as manufacturer_count,
    AVG(CAST(billunitspkg AS FLOAT)) as avg_billunits_per_pkg,
    MIN(pkg_size) as min_pkg_size,
    MAX(pkg_size) as max_pkg_size
  FROM mimi_ws_1.cmspayment.partb_drug_noc_ndc_to_hcpcs
  WHERE drug_generic_name IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY drug_generic_name, dosage
),

ranked_variations AS (
  -- Identify drugs with most package size variations
  SELECT *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY unique_pkg_sizes DESC) as pkg_variation_rank
  FROM pkg_metrics
  WHERE manufacturer_count > 1 -- Focus on drugs with multiple manufacturers
)

-- Final output showing drugs with significant package size variations
SELECT 
  drug_generic_name,
  dosage,
  manufacturer_count,
  unique_pkg_sizes,
  avg_billunits_per_pkg,
  min_pkg_size,
  max_pkg_size
FROM ranked_variations
WHERE pkg_variation_rank <= 20
ORDER BY unique_pkg_sizes DESC, manufacturer_count DESC;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. First CTE calculates key package metrics for each drug/dosage combination
-- 2. Second CTE ranks drugs by number of unique package sizes
-- 3. Final output shows top 20 drugs with most package size variations

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes pkg_size and billunitspkg fields are populated and accurate
-- - Limited to drugs with multiple manufacturers for comparison
-- - Does not account for temporal changes in packaging
-- - Package size variations may be clinically appropriate in some cases

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add pricing analysis to identify cost implications of package size variations
-- 2. Include therapeutic class analysis to compare similar drugs
-- 3. Trend analysis showing package size changes over time
-- 4. Add filters for specific drug classes or administration routes
-- 5. Compare package sizes across international markets

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on package size standardization opportunities by identifying drugs with multiple manufacturers and significant package size variations. Best used for formulary management and cost optimization analysis. Results may need clinical validation as some package size variations could be therapeutically necessary.
