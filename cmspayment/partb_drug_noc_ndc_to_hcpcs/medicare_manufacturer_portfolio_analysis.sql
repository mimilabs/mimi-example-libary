-- Main Query: Analyze manufacturer drug portfolios and product characteristics
WITH manufacturer_summary AS (
  SELECT 
    labeler_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ndc) as total_drugs,
    COUNT(DISTINCT drug_generic_name) as unique_generics,
    COUNT(DISTINCT drug_name) as unique_brands,
    -- Calculate percentage of branded vs generic products
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN drug_name != drug_generic_name THEN 1 END) / 
          COUNT(*), 1) as pct_branded
  FROM mimi_ws_1.cmspayment.partb_drug_noc_ndc_to_hcpcs
  WHERE labeler_name IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY labeler_name
)

SELECT
  labeler_name,
  total_drugs,
  unique_generics,
  unique_brands,
  pct_branded,
  -- Rank manufacturers by portfolio size
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_drugs DESC) as size_rank
FROM manufacturer_summary
WHERE total_drugs >= 5  -- Filter for significant manufacturers
ORDER BY total_drugs DESC
LIMIT 20;

/*
How it works:
1. Creates a summary per manufacturer showing their drug portfolio metrics
2. Calculates key indicators like total products and brand/generic mix
3. Ranks manufacturers by portfolio size
4. Returns top 20 manufacturers with significant presence

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes drug_name different from generic_name indicates branded product
- Limited to manufacturers with 5+ products for significance
- Point-in-time analysis based on latest data
- Does not account for drug volumes or revenue

Possible Extensions:
1. Add trending analysis across multiple quarters using mimi_src_file_date
2. Include dosage form analysis to show manufacturer specialization
3. Add market share calculations based on unique NDCs
4. Compare pricing across manufacturers for same generic drugs
5. Analyze geographic distribution of manufacturer presence

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on manufacturer-level analysis using NDC data from Medicare Part B. Main metrics include portfolio size, generic/brand mix, and relative market presence. Best used for strategic analysis of drug manufacturer market positioning and product mix strategies. Data granularity is at the NDC level, which may result in some products being counted multiple times if they have different package sizes or formulations.
