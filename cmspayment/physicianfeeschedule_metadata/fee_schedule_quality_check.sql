-- cms_fee_schedule_metadata_validation.sql
-- Business Purpose: This query performs quality validation and completeness checks 
-- on the CMS Physician Fee Schedule metadata to ensure data reliability and 
-- identify potential gaps in dataset coverage. This helps data stewards and 
-- analysts maintain data quality and plan for timely dataset updates.

/* How the query works:
1. Creates yearly statistics including counts of datasets, files with URLs, and entries with comments
2. Identifies data completeness issues and gaps by year
3. Calculates year-over-year changes in dataset counts
4. Returns a comprehensive data quality report ordered by most recent year

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Assumes year field is populated and valid
- Does not verify if URLs are still active/accessible
- Does not validate the content of comments
- Limited to metadata quality checks only

Possible Extensions:
1. Add URL validation checks to identify broken links
2. Include pattern matching on comments to ensure standardized descriptions
3. Add geographical coverage analysis if region information is available
4. Create alerts for years with significant data quality issues
5. Add trend analysis for dataset sizes and types over time */

    - Additional Notes: Query provides a comprehensive data quality dashboard for fee schedule metadata, focusing on completeness metrics and year-over-year changes. Best used for regular monitoring and validation of dataset coverage. Note that URL validation would require additional external tools or functions not included in this base query.
