Business Purpose:
This query analyzes the metadata of CMS Physician Fee Schedule datasets to help
researchers and analysts:
- Identify available fee schedule datasets by year
- Access download URLs and documentation
- Understand dataset descriptions and content
*******************************************************************************/

-- Get an overview of available Physician Fee Schedule datasets
-- Orders by most recent year first
SELECT 
    year AS effective_year,
    -- Extract filename from URL for easier reference
    REGEXP_EXTRACT(file_url, '[^/]+$') AS filename,
    -- Format comment for readability
    SUBSTRING(comment, 1, 100) AS description_preview,
    -- Include full URLs for access
    page_url AS documentation_url,
    file_url AS download_url
FROM mimi_ws_1.cmspayment.physicianfeeschedule_metadata
WHERE file_url IS NOT NULL  -- Ensure downloadable datasets only
ORDER BY year DESC;

/*******************************************************************************
How it works:
- Queries the metadata table for key dataset information
- Extracts filename from the full URL path
- Provides preview of dataset description
- Returns both documentation and download URLs
- Orders results chronologically with newest first

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes file_url entries follow consistent URL pattern
- Limited to datasets with download URLs available
- Description preview truncated to 100 chars for readability

Possible Extensions:
1. Add filtering by year range or keyword search in descriptions
2. Include statistics on file sizes or dataset versions
3. Compare dataset descriptions across years to track changes
4. Generate direct download links in preferred format
5. Add validation of active URLs
