Title: Medicare Part B NOC Drug Pricing Analysis
 
Business Purpose:
- Analyze pricing trends for Not Otherwise Classified (NOC) drugs under Medicare Part B
- Identify highest cost drugs and pricing variations over time
- Support decisions around drug cost management and policy planning
*******************************************************************************/

-- Main query to analyze NOC drug pricing patterns
SELECT 
    drug_generic_name_trade_name,
    dosage,
    -- Get most recent payment limit
    FIRST_VALUE(payment_limit) OVER (
        PARTITION BY drug_generic_name_trade_name, dosage 
        ORDER BY mimi_src_file_date DESC
    ) as current_payment,
    -- Calculate average historical payment
    AVG(payment_limit) OVER (
        PARTITION BY drug_generic_name_trade_name, dosage
    ) as avg_historical_payment,
    -- Get earliest available price for comparison
    FIRST_VALUE(payment_limit) OVER (
        PARTITION BY drug_generic_name_trade_name, dosage 
        ORDER BY mimi_src_file_date ASC
    ) as initial_payment,
    -- Include latest pricing date
    MAX(mimi_src_file_date) OVER (
        PARTITION BY drug_generic_name_trade_name, dosage
    ) as latest_price_date,
    notes
FROM mimi_ws_1.cmspayment.partb_drug_noc_pricing
-- Get distinct drug/dosage combinations
GROUP BY drug_generic_name_trade_name, dosage, payment_limit, notes, mimi_src_file_date
-- Order by current payment to highlight highest cost drugs
ORDER BY current_payment DESC;

/*******************************************************************************
How this query works:
1. Groups data by unique drug and dosage combinations
2. Uses window functions to calculate current, average and initial pricing
3. Maintains pricing history while showing latest rates
4. Includes relevant notes that may explain pricing factors

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Assumes most recent mimi_src_file_date represents current pricing
- Historical averages may be skewed by length of time in dataset
- Does not account for inflation or other economic factors
- Drug names/dosages must be consistent across time periods

Possible Extensions:
1. Add price change percentage calculations
2. Filter for specific date ranges or price thresholds
3. Group by drug categories or therapeutic classes
4. Add statistical analysis (std dev, median, etc.)
5. Compare NOC vs classified drug pricing

    - Additional Notes: Query tracks price changes for Medicare Part B NOC drugs over time, showing current vs historical pricing. Performance may be impacted with large datasets due to multiple window functions. Consider adding date range filters for better performance with historical data.
