-- RxNorm Active Drug Concept Distribution Analysis 
--
-- Business Purpose:
-- This analysis provides key insights into the active distribution of drug concepts across
-- different source vocabularies and term types. It helps:
-- 1. Understand which drug vocabularies contribute most to current prescribing practices
-- 2. Identify gaps in terminology coverage for medication management
-- 3. Support data quality initiatives in medication records
-- 4. Guide integration efforts with different drug knowledge bases

SELECT 
    sab as source_vocabulary,
    tty as term_type,
    suppress as suppression_status,
    -- Count distinct concepts to understand coverage
    COUNT(DISTINCT rxcui) as unique_concepts,
    -- Count total entries to understand granularity
    COUNT(*) as total_entries,
    -- Calculate average entries per concept
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT rxcui), 2) as avg_entries_per_concept
FROM mimi_ws_1.nlm.rxnconso
WHERE 
    -- Focus on active (non-suppressed) entries
    suppress = 'N'
    -- Consider only current data
    AND cvf = '4096'
    -- Standard English terminology
    AND lat = 'ENG'
GROUP BY 
    sab,
    tty,
    suppress
HAVING 
    -- Focus on meaningful distributions
    COUNT(DISTINCT rxcui) > 100
ORDER BY 
    unique_concepts DESC,
    source_vocabulary,
    term_type
LIMIT 50;

-- How This Query Works:
-- 1. Filters for active, current, English-language entries
-- 2. Groups by source vocabulary and term type
-- 3. Calculates key metrics around concept distribution
-- 4. Focuses on significant vocabulary sources (>100 concepts)
-- 5. Orders results by impact (number of unique concepts)

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes current prescribable content (cvf='4096') is most relevant
-- - Limited to English language terms
-- - Does not account for historical changes
-- - Focuses on active (non-suppressed) content only

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add trend analysis by including mimi_src_file_date
-- 2. Compare suppressible vs non-suppressible content distribution
-- 3. Add specific drug class analysis by incorporating str patterns
-- 4. Create coverage comparison across different source vocabularies
-- 5. Add metrics for brand vs generic distribution within sources

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on active drug concepts distribution but excludes non-English and suppressed entries. Best used for understanding current medication terminology coverage across vocabularies. Consider adjusting the HAVING clause threshold (>100) based on specific analysis needs.
