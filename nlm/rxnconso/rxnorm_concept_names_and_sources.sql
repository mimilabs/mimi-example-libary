-- RxNorm Concept Names and Sources (RXNCONSO) Analysis

-- This query provides insights into the RxNorm vocabulary, which is a crucial resource for healthcare and pharmaceutical research.
-- The RXNCONSO table includes comprehensive information about RxNorm concepts, including their unique identifiers, language, source vocabularies, and more.
-- By analyzing this data, researchers and developers can gain valuable insights into the structure and content of the RxNorm vocabulary.

SELECT
  sab, -- Source abbreviation
  COUNT(DISTINCT rxcui) AS unique_concepts, -- Number of unique concepts per source
  COUNT(DISTINCT rxaui) AS unique_atoms, -- Number of unique atoms per source
  COUNT(*) AS total_rows -- Total number of rows per source
FROM
  mimi_ws_1.nlm.rxnconso
GROUP BY
  sab
ORDER BY
  unique_concepts DESC;

-- The main insights from this query are:
-- 1. It provides a breakdown of the number of unique concepts, unique atoms, and total rows per source vocabulary in the RxNorm dataset.
-- 2. This information can be used to understand the relative importance and coverage of different source vocabularies within RxNorm.
-- 3. Knowing the distribution of concepts and atoms across sources can help researchers and developers plan their work and identify potential gaps or areas of focus.

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - The data in the RXNCONSO table represents a snapshot in time and may not reflect the latest changes in the RxNorm vocabulary.
-- - The table does not contain historical information or track changes over time, so it cannot be used for longitudinal analyses.
-- - The table does not include the full details of the source vocabularies themselves, only the mapping between RxNorm and those sources.

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Analyze the distribution of concept names by language to understand the linguistic diversity of the RxNorm vocabulary.
-- 2. Investigate the relationships between source asserted atom identifiers (SAUIs) and source asserted concept identifiers (SCUIs) to better understand the mapping between RxNorm and its source vocabularies.
-- 3. Combine the RXNCONSO data with other RxNorm tables, such as RXNREL, to explore the relationships between different RxNorm concepts and their attributes.
