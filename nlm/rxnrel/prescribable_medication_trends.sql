-- Title: RxNorm Time-Series Analysis of Prescribable Medication Changes
--
-- Business Purpose:
-- This query helps healthcare organizations track and analyze changes in prescribable medications over time to:
-- - Monitor additions and removals of medications from prescribable content
-- - Identify trends in medication relationships for formulary planning
-- - Support medication inventory and procurement decisions
-- - Enable proactive updates to e-prescribing systems

WITH prescribable_changes AS (
    -- Get the distinct combinations of relationships and dates
    SELECT 
        mimi_src_file_date,
        rxcui1,
        rxcui2,
        rel,
        rela,
        cvf
    FROM mimi_ws_1.nlm.rxnrel
    WHERE cvf = '4096' -- Focus on currently prescribable medications
),

time_series_metrics AS (
    -- Calculate metrics for each date
    SELECT 
        mimi_src_file_date,
        COUNT(DISTINCT rxcui1) as unique_source_drugs,
        COUNT(DISTINCT rxcui2) as unique_target_drugs,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN rel = 'SY' THEN rxcui1 END) as synonym_relationships,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN rela = 'has_ingredient' THEN rxcui1 END) as ingredient_relationships
    FROM prescribable_changes
    GROUP BY mimi_src_file_date
)

-- Generate final trend analysis
SELECT 
    mimi_src_file_date,
    unique_source_drugs,
    unique_target_drugs,
    synonym_relationships,
    ingredient_relationships,
    LAG(unique_source_drugs) OVER (ORDER BY mimi_src_file_date) as prev_source_drugs,
    ((unique_source_drugs - LAG(unique_source_drugs) OVER (ORDER BY mimi_src_file_date)) / 
     NULLIF(LAG(unique_source_drugs) OVER (ORDER BY mimi_src_file_date), 0) * 100) as pct_change_source_drugs
FROM time_series_metrics
ORDER BY mimi_src_file_date;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. First CTE (prescribable_changes) filters for currently prescribable medications
-- 2. Second CTE (time_series_metrics) calculates key metrics for each date
-- 3. Final SELECT adds period-over-period comparisons and percentage changes
-- 4. Results are ordered chronologically to show trends

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes cvf='4096' consistently identifies prescribable content
-- - Limited to relationships present in RxNorm
-- - Does not account for seasonal variations
-- - Percentage changes may be affected by data quality issues

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add rolling averages to smooth out fluctuations
-- 2. Include specific relationship type trends
-- 3. Add materialized views for performance optimization
-- 4. Create alerts for significant changes in medication relationships
-- 5. Compare changes across different relationship types (ingredient vs brand name)

    - Additional Notes: Query provides a time-series analysis of prescribable medication changes in RxNorm, tracking metrics like unique drugs and relationship types over time. Performance may be impacted with large date ranges, consider adding date filters for specific analysis periods. The percentage change calculations will show NULL for the first row due to the LAG function.
