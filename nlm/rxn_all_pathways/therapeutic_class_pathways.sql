-- therapeutic_class_path_analysis.sql
--
-- Business Purpose:
-- This query analyzes therapeutic class relationships in RxNorm by examining paths 
-- between medications and their therapeutic classes. This information is valuable for:
-- 1. Formulary management - understanding drug classification hierarchies
-- 2. Clinical decision support - identifying therapeutic alternatives
-- 3. Quality metrics - grouping medications by therapeutic intent
-- 4. Cost analysis - comparing medications within therapeutic categories

WITH therapeutic_paths AS (
    -- Focus on paths between medications and their therapeutic classes
    SELECT DISTINCT
        source_rxcui,
        source_name,
        source_tty,
        target_rxcui,
        target_name,
        target_tty,
        path
    FROM mimi_ws_1.nlm.rxn_all_pathways
    WHERE source_tty IN ('SCD', 'BN') -- Clinical drugs and brand names
    AND target_tty = 'EPC' -- Established Pharmacologic Class
),

path_metrics AS (
    -- Calculate path complexity metrics
    SELECT 
        target_name AS therapeutic_class,
        COUNT(DISTINCT source_rxcui) AS medication_count,
        AVG(CARDINALITY(SPLIT(path, '/'))) AS avg_path_length,
        COUNT(DISTINCT path) AS unique_paths
    FROM therapeutic_paths
    GROUP BY target_name
)

-- Generate final analysis
SELECT 
    therapeutic_class,
    medication_count,
    ROUND(avg_path_length, 2) AS avg_path_length,
    unique_paths
FROM path_metrics
WHERE medication_count >= 5  -- Focus on classes with meaningful representation
ORDER BY medication_count DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. First CTE filters paths to focus on clinical drugs/brands to therapeutic classes
-- 2. Second CTE calculates metrics about path complexity and medication counts
-- 3. Final SELECT presents most significant therapeutic classes by medication count
--
-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes EPC (Established Pharmacologic Class) represents therapeutic classes
-- - Limited to direct relationships in the paths table
-- - Minimum threshold of 5 medications per class may exclude rare therapeutic categories
--
-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add analysis of intermediate nodes in paths to understand classification patterns
-- 2. Compare brand name vs generic therapeutic classifications
-- 3. Analyze therapeutic class overlap (medications in multiple classes)
-- 4. Include temporal analysis if historical data is available
-- 5. Add cost analysis by linking to pricing data

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on analyzing RxNorm therapeutic classifications by calculating path metrics between medications and their therapeutic classes. Note that the minimum threshold of 5 medications per class may need adjustment based on specific use cases, and the EPC (Established Pharmacologic Class) filtering might need expansion to include other therapeutic classification systems depending on organizational needs.
