    - Additional Notes: The query provides a comprehensive view of the NDC/HCPCS crosswalk data, filtering for the most recent data and ordering the results to show the latest relationship for each NDC-HCPCS pair. The limitations include the snapshot nature of the data and the lack of provider-specific information. Potential extensions could analyze the distribution of HCPCS codes, track changes in relationships over time, and explore billing and reimbursement practices.
