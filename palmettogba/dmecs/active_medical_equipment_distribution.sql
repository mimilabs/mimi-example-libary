Title: DMECS Product Analysis - Active Medical Equipment Distribution
 
Business Purpose:
- Analyze current distribution of active DMEPOS products across manufacturers
- Identify most common types of medical equipment based on HCPCS codes
- Track new product additions to understand market dynamics
- Support decisions around medical equipment procurement and pricing

/*
How it works:
1. CTE filters for active products (no end date) and groups by manufacturer/HCPCS
2. Main query aggregates to manufacturer level to show product portfolio
3. Results show top 20 manufacturers by total product count

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes NULL end_date indicates currently active product
- Limited to manufacturers with valid names (non-NULL)
- Does not account for seasonal or temporary product discontinuations
- Top 20 limit may exclude smaller manufacturers

Possible Extensions:
1. Add time-based trending by analyzing products added per quarter
2. Include product categories by mapping HCPCS codes to standard groups
3. Compare active vs discontinued product ratios by manufacturer
4. Analyze average product lifecycle by manufacturer
5. Add geographic analysis if location data available

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on active products only and requires manufacturer names to be non-null. Results are limited to top 20 manufacturers by product count. Performance may be impacted with very large datasets due to multiple aggregations. Consider adding date filters if analyzing specific time periods.
