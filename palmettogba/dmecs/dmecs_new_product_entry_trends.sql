-- DMECS Market Entry Analysis
-- Business Purpose: 
-- - Track and analyze new product introductions in the DMEPOS market
-- - Identify manufacturers driving innovation through new product launches
-- - Monitor product entry patterns and seasonal trends
-- - Support strategic planning for market competition analysis

WITH monthly_entries AS (
    -- Aggregate new product entries by month and manufacturer
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('month', effective_date) as entry_month,
        manufacturer,
        COUNT(*) as new_products,
        COUNT(DISTINCT hcpcs_code) as unique_hcpcs,
        ARRAY_JOIN(COLLECT_SET(hcpcs_code), ', ') as hcpcs_list
    FROM mimi_ws_1.palmettogba.dmecs
    WHERE indicator = 'A' -- Focus on new additions only
        AND effective_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, 365) -- Last 12 months
    GROUP BY 1, 2
),

manufacturer_stats AS (
    -- Calculate manufacturer-level statistics
    SELECT 
        manufacturer,
        SUM(new_products) as total_new_products,
        SUM(unique_hcpcs) as total_unique_hcpcs,
        COUNT(DISTINCT entry_month) as active_months
    FROM monthly_entries
    GROUP BY 1
)

-- Final result combining monthly trends with manufacturer stats
SELECT 
    me.entry_month,
    me.manufacturer,
    me.new_products,
    me.unique_hcpcs,
    me.hcpcs_list,
    ms.total_new_products,
    ms.total_unique_hcpcs,
    ms.active_months,
    ROUND(ms.total_new_products / ms.active_months, 2) as avg_monthly_products
FROM monthly_entries me
JOIN manufacturer_stats ms ON me.manufacturer = ms.manufacturer
WHERE ms.total_new_products >= 5 -- Focus on more active manufacturers
ORDER BY me.entry_month DESC, me.new_products DESC;

-- How it works:
-- 1. First CTE aggregates new product entries by month and manufacturer
-- 2. Second CTE calculates overall statistics for each manufacturer
-- 3. Final query joins these together to show both monthly trends and overall context
-- 4. Results are filtered to focus on more active manufacturers

-- Assumptions and limitations:
-- - Assumes 'A' indicator reliably identifies new product entries
-- - Limited to last 12 months of data
-- - Minimum threshold of 5 products may exclude smaller but innovative manufacturers
-- - Does not account for product discontinuations or updates

-- Possible extensions:
-- 1. Add seasonality analysis to identify peak months for product launches
-- 2. Include product category analysis based on HCPCS code patterns
-- 3. Compare new product entry rates against market size or revenue data
-- 4. Add year-over-year comparison to identify long-term trends
-- 5. Link with pricing data to analyze market entry strategies

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on manufacturers' new product introduction patterns over the last 12 months. The threshold of 5+ products may need adjustment based on market dynamics. COLLECT_SET function requires products to be unique within the aggregation. Consider adjusting the 365-day lookback period based on business needs.
