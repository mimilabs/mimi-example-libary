-- Analysis of MedlinePlus Language Mapped Topics

-- This query provides an overview of the language-specific translations or variants of topics in the MedlinePlus knowledge base.
-- The goal is to understand the distribution of translated topics across languages and identify any patterns or insights that could inform content development and accessibility.

SELECT
  language,
  COUNT(*) AS num_topics,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mimi_ws_1.medlineplus.language_mapped_topic), 2) AS pct_of_total
FROM
  mimi_ws_1.medlineplus.language_mapped_topic
GROUP BY
  language
ORDER BY
  num_topics DESC;

-- This query first groups the rows by the 'language' column and counts the number of topics for each language.
-- It then calculates the percentage of the total number of mapped topics that each language represents.
-- The results are ordered by the number of topics in descending order to show the most common languages first.

-- The business value of this analysis is to:
-- 1. Understand the breadth and distribution of translated topics in the MedlinePlus knowledge base.
-- 2. Identify languages that have a high number of translated topics, which could indicate areas of strength and focus.
-- 3. Detect languages with relatively few translated topics, which could represent opportunities to expand content and improve accessibility.
-- 4. Monitor changes in the distribution of translated topics over time to track the evolution and growth of the knowledge base.

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - The data in the 'language_mapped_topic' table represents a snapshot in time and may not reflect the current state of the MedlinePlus knowledge base.
-- - The table does not contain information about the quality or accuracy of the translations, only the existence of translated topics.
-- - The analysis focuses on the distribution of topics across languages, but does not provide insights into the specific content or topics that are translated.

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Analyze the most commonly translated topics to identify the content areas that are prioritized for translation.
-- 2. Investigate the relationship between the original topic and its translated versions, looking for patterns in content, structure, or popularity.
-- 3. Explore the update frequency of translated topics and identify any significant differences across languages, which could suggest prioritization or resource constraints.
-- 4. Combine the data from this table with other MedlinePlus datasets to gain a more holistic understanding of the knowledge base and its evolution over time.
