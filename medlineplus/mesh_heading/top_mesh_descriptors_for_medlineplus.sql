-- Exploring Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) for MedlinePlus Topics

/*
This query explores the business value of the `mimi_ws_1.medlineplus.mesh_heading` table, which provides a mapping between MedlinePlus topics and their corresponding Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors.

The key business value of this data includes:
1. Enabling researchers to understand the relationships between MedlinePlus topics and standardized medical terminology.
2. Allowing for improved information retrieval and search functionality for medical information systems by leveraging the MeSH descriptors.
3. Enabling analysis of how MeSH descriptor associations with MedlinePlus topics have changed over time.
4. Providing insights into the most frequently used MeSH descriptors across MedlinePlus topics.

SELECT
  descriptor,
  COUNT(*) AS topic_count
FROM mimi_ws_1.medlineplus.mesh_heading
GROUP BY descriptor
ORDER BY topic_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

/*
This query identifies the 10 most frequently used MeSH descriptors across all MedlinePlus topics. This can provide valuable insights into the most important or commonly referenced medical concepts and terminology within the MedlinePlus dataset.

The key steps are:
1. Select the `descriptor` column and count the number of associated topics for each descriptor.
2. Group the results by the `descriptor` column to aggregate the counts.
3. Order the results by the `topic_count` column in descending order to show the most frequently used descriptors first.
4. Limit the output to the top 10 rows.

This query can be extended to:
- Analyze how the top MeSH descriptors have changed over time by looking at the `mimi_src_file_date` column.
- Explore the relationships between the most frequently used MeSH descriptors and the associated MedlinePlus topics.
- Compare the MeSH descriptor usage in the MedlinePlus dataset to other biomedical databases or ontologies.
