This query provides insights into the health topics available on the MedlinePlus website,
which is a valuable resource for patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals
seeking reliable and up-to-date information on various medical conditions and wellness topics.

/*
This query provides an overview of the health topics available on MedlinePlus, grouped by the
language in which the content is written. The results show the total number of topics for each
language, as well as the percentage of the total number of topics that each language represents.

This information can be valuable for understanding the linguistic diversity of the MedlinePlus
content, and identifying potential gaps or areas where additional language support may be
needed to reach a wider audience.

For example, if the data shows that the majority of health topics are available in English,
but a significant portion of the target population speaks other languages, the organization
may want to prioritize translating more content into those languages to improve accessibility
and usefulness of the MedlinePlus resources.

Additionally, the 'date_created' column could be analyzed to understand the growth and evolution
of the MedlinePlus health topic library over time, which could inform content development
strategies and resource allocation decisions.

Assumptions and Limitations:
- The data in the 'health_topic' table is comprehensive and accurately reflects the current
  state of the MedlinePlus health topic content.
- The 'language' column accurately represents the language of the content, and there are no
  issues with data quality or consistency in this field.
- The analysis focuses on the language distribution of the health topics, but does not provide
  insights into the specific topics covered, their popularity, or the depth and quality of
  the content.

Possible Extensions:
- Analyze the 'title' and 'full_summary' columns to identify common keywords, topics, or
  trends in the health content.
- Investigate the relationship between the 'date_created' and 'mimi_src_file_date' columns
  to understand the timeliness and frequency of updates to the MedlinePlus health topics.
- Explore the 'url' column to provide direct links to the health topics, enabling users to
  easily access the full content.
- Combine the 'health_topic' data with other MedlinePlus tables (e.g., 'health_resource')
  to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the available content and resources.
