-- Main analysis of organizations contributing to MedlinePlus sites
WITH org_metrics AS (
    -- Calculate key metrics for each organization
    SELECT 
        organization,
        COUNT(DISTINCT site_id) as num_sites,
        MIN(mimi_src_file_date) as first_contribution,
        MAX(mimi_src_file_date) as latest_contribution,
        DATEDIFF(MAX(mimi_src_file_date), MIN(mimi_src_file_date)) as days_active
    FROM mimi_ws_1.medlineplus.organization
    WHERE organization IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY organization
)

SELECT
    organization,
    num_sites,
    first_contribution,
    latest_contribution,
    days_active,
    -- Calculate relative contribution percentage
    ROUND(100.0 * num_sites / SUM(num_sites) OVER (), 2) as pct_of_total_sites

/*******************************************************************************
How the Query Works:
1. Creates a CTE to calculate core metrics for each organization
2. Aggregates data to show number of sites, contribution timespan
3. Calculates percentage contribution relative to total sites
4. Returns top 20 organizations by number of sites managed

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes organization names are standardized
- Limited to organizations with non-null names
- Shows only top 20 contributors
- Historical data limited by mimi_src_file_date range
- Does not account for organization mergers/changes

Possible Extensions:
1. Add trending analysis to show growth patterns:
   - Year-over-year change in site contributions
   - Seasonal patterns in organization activity

2. Enhanced organization profiling:
   - Join with site content data to analyze content types
   - Geographic distribution of sites per organization
   
3. Quality metrics:
   - Site engagement metrics per organization
   - Content freshness analysis
   - Cross-reference with external quality ratings

4. Partnership analysis:
   - Co-occurrence analysis of organizations
   - Network analysis of organization relationships

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on organization contribution patterns and may need index optimization for large datasets. Consider adjusting LIMIT clause based on total number of organizations. Dates in results depend on data freshness in mimi_src_file_date column.
