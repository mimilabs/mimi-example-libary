Title: Health Topic Alternative Names Analysis
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes alternative names (aliases) for health topics to help:
- Improve search functionality and discoverability of health information
- Understand common terminology variations for medical conditions
- Support content optimization for better public health communication
*******************************************************************************/

-- Main query to get frequency of alternative names per topic
WITH alias_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    topic_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT alias) as num_aliases,
    -- Collect all aliases into an array for reference
    COLLECT_LIST(alias) as all_aliases
  FROM mimi_ws_1.medlineplus.also_called
  GROUP BY topic_id
),
ranked_topics AS (
  SELECT
    topic_id,
    num_aliases,
    all_aliases,
    -- Rank topics by number of alternative names
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY num_aliases DESC) as topic_rank
  FROM alias_counts
)
SELECT
  topic_id,
  num_aliases,
  all_aliases,
  topic_rank
FROM ranked_topics 
WHERE topic_rank <= 10  -- Focus on top 10 topics with most aliases
ORDER BY topic_rank;

/*******************************************************************************
How the Query Works:
1. First CTE (alias_counts) groups aliases by topic_id and counts distinct names
2. Second CTE (ranked_topics) ranks topics by number of alternative names
3. Final output shows top 10 topics with most alternative names and lists them

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes topic_id is consistently mapped across related tables
- Limited to counting distinct aliases only
- Does not account for similarity between aliases
- No weighting for more commonly used aliases

Possible Extensions:
1. JOIN with topic details table to show actual topic names
2. Add temporal analysis using mimi_src_file_date
3. Analyze alias patterns (length, word count, medical vs common terms)
4. Add fuzzy matching to group similar aliases
5. Calculate overlap in aliases between related topics

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on identifying health topics with the most alternative names, which is valuable for content optimization and search functionality. Note that the effectiveness of this analysis could be enhanced by joining with a topics master table to include actual topic names in the output. The COLLECT_LIST function used may require adjustment based on the size of the dataset and memory constraints.
