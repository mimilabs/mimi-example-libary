-- Analyze MedlinePlus Topics in Other Languages

/* This query demonstrates the core business value of the `medlineplus.other_language` table by providing insights into the availability and distribution of MedlinePlus health topics in languages other than English.

The key business value of this data is to understand how the MedlinePlus platform is serving the multilingual needs of its users, which can help guide content localization efforts and improve access to critical health information for diverse audiences.

SELECT 
  vernacular_name, 
  COUNT(*) AS topic_count,
  mimi_src_file_date
FROM medlineplus.other_language
GROUP BY vernacular_name, mimi_src_file_date
ORDER BY topic_count DESC;

/*
This query provides the following insights:

1. It identifies the most common languages in which MedlinePlus topics are translated, by counting the number of topics available in each language.
2. It also shows the date of the data extract, which can be used to track how the availability of translated topics has changed over time.

By understanding the most popular translated languages, content managers can prioritize their localization efforts to ensure the highest-demand health information is available in multiple languages. Additionally, tracking changes in the number of translated topics can reveal trends in the platform's multilingual content growth and coverage.

-- How this query works:
-- 1. The query selects the `vernacular_name` column (the name of the topic in the other language) and the `mimi_src_file_date` column (the date the data was extracted).
-- 2. It counts the number of topics for each unique combination of language and extraction date, using the `COUNT(*)` aggregation function.
-- 3. The results are ordered by the `topic_count` column in descending order, to show the most common languages first.

-- Assumptions and limitations:
-- - The data only represents a snapshot of the MedlinePlus content at a specific point in time, as indicated by the `mimi_src_file_date`.
-- - The query does not provide any information about the actual content or topics being translated, only the language distribution.
-- - The query does not differentiate between the availability of translations for different health categories or specialties.

-- Possible extensions:
-- 1. Analyze the distribution of translated topics across different health categories or medical specialties.
-- 2. Investigate the relationship between topic popularity (e.g., based on user access) and the availability of translations.
-- 3. Track the frequency of updates to the translated versions of topics compared to the English versions.
-- 4. Identify any regional or cultural patterns in the types of topics that are more frequently translated.

    - Additional Notes: This query provides insights into the availability and distribution of MedlinePlus health topics in languages other than English. It identifies the most common translated languages and tracks changes in the number of translated topics over time. However, it does not provide information about the actual content or topics being translated, nor does it differentiate between the availability of translations for different health categories or specialties.
