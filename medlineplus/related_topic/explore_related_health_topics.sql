-- Explore Relationships Between Health Topics

-- This query demonstrates the core business value of the mimi_ws_1.medlineplus.related_topic table.
-- It allows users to navigate from a main health topic to related topics, enabling them to discover
-- relevant information and broaden their understanding of a particular health subject.

SELECT 
  t1.related_title AS main_topic, 
  t2.related_title AS related_topic, 
  t2.url AS related_topic_url
FROM mimi_ws_1.medlineplus.related_topic t1
JOIN mimi_ws_1.medlineplus.related_topic t2 ON t1.related_id = t2.topic_id
WHERE t1.topic_id = 'D000071' -- Provide the ID of the main topic you want to explore
ORDER BY t2.related_title;

/*
How the query works:
1. The query joins the related_topic table with itself to establish the relationship between main topics and their related topics.
2. It selects the related_title columns from both tables, representing the main topic and its related topics.
3. The url column from the related_topic table is also selected, providing a direct link to the related topic's page or resource.
4. The WHERE clause filters the results to a specific main topic of interest, identified by its topic_id.
5. The results are ordered alphabetically by the related_topic name.

Assumptions and limitations:
- The query assumes that the topic_id of the main topic you want to explore is known. You can replace 'D000071' with the ID of the topic you're interested in.
- The data in the related_topic table represents a snapshot of the relationships at a specific point in time, as indicated by the mimi_src_file_date column.
- The table does not contain any personally identifiable information or sensitive data, as it focuses solely on the connections between health topics.

Possible extensions:
1. Analyze the most commonly related topics for a given main topic, and explore how these relationships vary across different health categories.
2. Visualize the network of related topics to identify clusters or communities of closely connected health subjects.
3. Investigate patterns or trends in the types of relationships between main topics and their related topics, such as hierarchical, associative, or causal relationships.
4. Use the data to recommend personalized content or resources to users based on their interests or browsing history.
5. Leverage the information to improve search functionality and information retrieval within the MedlinePlus knowledge base or similar health information systems.
