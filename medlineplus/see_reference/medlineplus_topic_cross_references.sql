-- Exploring Topic Cross-References in MedlinePlus

-- Business Purpose:
-- The see_reference table in the mimi_ws_1.medlineplus database provides valuable insights into the cross-reference relationships between topics and concepts within the MedlinePlus knowledge base.
-- This query aims to identify the most frequently referenced topics, which can help improve the discoverability and navigation of related health information for MedlinePlus users.

SELECT 
  reference,
  COUNT(*) AS reference_count,
  MAX(mimi_src_file_date) AS latest_update_date
FROM mimi_ws_1.medlineplus.see_reference
GROUP BY reference
ORDER BY reference_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Explanation:
-- 1. We select the 'reference' column, which represents the related topic or concept that the user should also see or refer to.
-- 2. We count the number of occurrences for each 'reference' value to find the most frequently referenced topics.
-- 3. We also include the latest 'mimi_src_file_date' to understand the most recent update to the cross-reference information.
-- 4. The results are ordered by the 'reference_count' in descending order, and we limit the output to the top 10 most frequently referenced topics.

-- How the Query Works:
-- This query aggregates the data from the see_reference table, grouping by the 'reference' column and counting the number of occurrences for each value.
-- The MAX function is used to retrieve the latest 'mimi_src_file_date' for each reference, providing insight into the temporal aspect of the cross-reference information.
-- By ordering the results by the 'reference_count' in descending order and limiting the output, we can identify the most frequently referenced topics in the MedlinePlus knowledge base.

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- This query assumes that the 'reference' column accurately represents the related topics or concepts that users should refer to.
-- The analysis is limited to the top 10 most frequently referenced topics, and researchers may want to explore a larger or different subset of the data depending on their specific research questions.
-- It's important to consider the temporal aspect of the data, as the 'mimi_src_file_date' indicates when the cross-reference information was last updated.

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Analyze the evolution of cross-reference relationships over time by comparing the 'mimi_src_file_date' across different time periods.
-- 2. Identify clusters or groups of highly interconnected topics to understand the thematic organization of the MedlinePlus knowledge base.
-- 3. Investigate the differences in cross-reference patterns across various medical specialties or health conditions.
-- 4. Explore the potential use of this data to improve search relevance and recommendation systems for MedlinePlus users.
