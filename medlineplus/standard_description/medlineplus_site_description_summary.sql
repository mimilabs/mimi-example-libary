Title: Site Description Analysis for MedlinePlus Data
 
Business Purpose:
- Analyze the standardized site descriptions to understand the types of medical 
  sites covered in MedlinePlus
- Track how site descriptions have evolved over time
- Provide foundation for site categorization and quality analysis

Created: 2024-02-14

-- Main query to analyze site descriptions and their distribution over time
SELECT 
    -- Get high-level metrics about site descriptions
    COUNT(DISTINCT site_id) as total_unique_sites,
    COUNT(DISTINCT description) as unique_descriptions,
    
    -- Look at description patterns
    AVG(LENGTH(description)) as avg_description_length,
    
    -- Get time-based metrics
    DATE_FORMAT(MAX(mimi_src_file_date), 'yyyy-MM-dd') as latest_source_date,
    DATE_FORMAT(MIN(mimi_src_file_date), 'yyyy-MM-dd') as earliest_source_date,
    
    -- Calculate date ranges
    DATEDIFF(MAX(mimi_src_file_date), MIN(mimi_src_file_date)) as days_between_updates

FROM mimi_ws_1.medlineplus.standard_description;

/*******************************************************************************
How this query works:
1. Counts distinct sites and descriptions to understand data coverage
2. Analyzes description content patterns through length metrics
3. Examines the time range of the data to understand currency and update frequency

Assumptions:
- All site_ids are valid and unique
- Description field contains meaningful standardized text
- mimi_src_file_date accurately reflects when data was current

Limitations:
- Does not analyze description content/quality
- Cannot detect duplicate/similar descriptions with minor variations
- Time analysis limited to file dates rather than actual site update dates

Possible Extensions:
1. Add description content analysis:
   - Common words/phrases
   - Description categories
   - Length distribution

2. Time-based analysis:
   - Description changes over time
   - Update frequency by site
   - Seasonal patterns

3. Quality metrics:
   - Completeness of descriptions
   - Standardization compliance
   - Cross-reference with related tables

4. Site categorization:
   - Group sites by description characteristics
   - Identify specialty areas
   - Geographic distribution if available

    - Additional Notes: Query provides high-level metrics about site descriptions but does not include actual description text analysis. Consider adding WHERE clauses to filter by date ranges if the dataset is large. The DATEDIFF calculation assumes continuous data collection between min and max dates.
