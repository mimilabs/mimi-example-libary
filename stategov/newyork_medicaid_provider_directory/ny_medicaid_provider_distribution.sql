/*
How it works:
1. Creates a CTE to aggregate provider counts by county and specialty
2. Uses the most recent data based on file_date
3. Calculates total providers and those serving fragile populations
4. Presents results filtered and sorted for meaningful analysis

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Assumes current file_date represents most accurate data
- Limited to active NY providers only
- Minimum threshold of 5 providers per specialty for significance
- Does not account for provider capacity or patient volume
- Geographic analysis at county level only

Possible Extensions:
1. Add temporal analysis to track provider trends over time:
   - Include year-over-year comparisons
   - Track specialty growth rates

2. Enhance geographic analysis:
   - Add population density context
   - Calculate providers per capita
   - Include distance/accessibility metrics

3. Specialty focus:
   - Compare urban vs rural distribution
   - Analyze specific high-need specialties
   - Cross-reference with demographic data

4. Provider accessibility:
   - Include language capabilities
   - Analyze appointment availability
   - Calculate distance to nearest specialist

For accurate results, ensure the table is regularly updated with current provider data. Performance may be impacted with very large datasets due to the distinct count operations.
